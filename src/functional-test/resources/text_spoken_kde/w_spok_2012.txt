It was n't the usual his-and-her split-up of assets in a divorce settlement , now all these belonged to him to be used on her . 65 pounds of explosives , a pair of handcuffs , a gun and a rope to be turned into a noose . And what had been their home now wired with surveillance equipment , so nobody could get in and no one could get out . @!ROBIN-ROBERTS-@1-A# @(Voiceover) Just three weeks ago , Nancy Tyler , with her children by her side , walked into court for what she hopes will be the final chapter in a disturbing and violent saga . @!NANCY-TYLER-@1RICH# Over the years leading up to the kidnapping , Mr. Shenkman stalked me ... @!ROBIN-ROBERTS-@1-A# @(Voiceover) As she reads from her victim 's impact statement in this Connecticut courtroom , the man who has tormented her looks on , her ex-husband of 12 years , Richard Shenkman. @!NANCY-TYLER-@1RICH# Mr. Shenkman named his battle the war of the Tylers , but he was the only one at war . The rest of us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @(Voiceover) Shenkman 's war of the Tylers was a reference to " The War of the Roses . " @!KATHLEEN-TURNER-@1# I am the one who found this house . I bought everything in it . @!MICHAEL-DOUGLAS-@1# And with my money . It 's a lot easier to spend it than to make it , honeybun. @!ROBIN-ROBERTS-@1-A# @(Voiceover) A popular film in which a divorcing couple , played by Michael Douglas and Kathleen Turner , both end up dead . Nancy Tyler 's recollections of her abusive marriage to Shenkman are a far cry from the life she imagined for herself in 1992 , when she was set up on a blind date with a charismatic TV producer . @!NANCY-TYLER-@1RICH# You know , I was n't really looking for someone . I had my two children , and my father was ill at the time , so things were a little bit upside down . And he came along , and we got along well . @!ROBIN-ROBERTS-@1-A# @(Off-camera) And was it the first time that you kind of leaned on somebody else ? @!NANCY-TYLER-@1RICH# The first time in a while . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in control and seemed to have it all together . @!ROBIN-ROBERTS-@1-A# @(Voiceover) Shenkman seemed like the answer to Nancy 's prayers . She had suffered a heart attack just before they met and now says that may have made her more vulnerable to Shenkman 's charms and blind to what he was truly capable of . @!RICHARD-SHENKMAN-@# We 're all going down in flames . I 'm gon na destroy your life . @!ROBIN-ROBERTS-@1-A# @(Voiceover) They were married after a year and a half of dating , his third trip to the altar and her second . Nancy says things were fine in the very beginning of their marriage . They lived in a prosperous suburb of Hartford , Connecticut , and bought a Victorian beach house on the shore . @!CLIP-FROM- " THE-GAY# @!ROBIN-ROBERTS-@1-A# @(Voiceover) Shenkman owned a TV studio and produced " The Gayle King Show . " He adopted Nancy 's children , Victoria and Peter . But it was n't long before Nancy began to detect a darker side of her husband 's personality . @!ROBIN-ROBERTS-@1-A# @(Off-camera) When did you notice the change ? @!NANCY-TYLER-@1RICH# Things were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relationship went on , he became much more controlling . When he was angry , everybody knew it . And he screamed , he yelled , sometimes threw things . He would slam his fist against the wall , foul mouth , and just , just very obviously out of control . @!ROBIN-ROBERTS-@1-A# @(Off-camera) So he would be verbally abusive ? @!NANCY-TYLER-@1RICH# Yes . @!ROBIN-ROBERTS-@1-A# @(Off-camera) Mentally abusive ? @!NANCY-TYLER-@1RICH# Yes . @!ROBIN-ROBERTS-@1-A# @(Off-camera) Physically ? @!NANCY-TYLER-@1RICH# Not really , no . It was not , certainly , bruising and broken bones , things like that . @!ROBIN-ROBERTS-@1-A# @(Off-camera) Is it sometimes harder to explain to people if you do n't have the black eye or you do n't have the broken bones or something like that ? @!NANCY-TYLER-@1RICH# I think it 's harder to explain , but , and it 's also a reason why people do n't seek help . @!ROBIN-ROBERTS-@1-A# @(Voiceover) Nancy 's sister Marilyn says even her closest family members had no idea what Shenkman was doing to her . @!MARILYN-COMEY-@1NA# He kept her isolated . He evidently told her that her family did n't care about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @(Voiceover) Nancy 's son , Peter . @!PETER-@1NANCY-TYLE# She made a very clear effort to shield us from it and to keep us out of the mix . @!ROBIN-ROBERTS-@1-A# @(Voiceover) Nancy feared that should she file for divorce , that Shenkman would fight her for custody of her children . So they tried to make the best of it . @!PETER-@1NANCY-TYLE# Any misstep , even if we did n't know that it was a misstep , could set off the minefield . @!ROBIN-ROBERTS-@1-A# @(Voiceover) But it would be a fight between Shenkman and Nancy 's 16-year-old son over the use of his car that would ultimately finish off their crumbling marriage . @!NANCY-TYLER-@1RICH# My ex-husband just snapped . @!PETER-@1NANCY-TYLE# He ran out into the garage and ripped the license plate off of the car so that I could n't drive it and starts screaming , bloodcurdling shrieking . @!NANCY-TYLER-@1RICH# Hearing the way he was talking to my son , I knew that this was it . It could not go on any longer . @!ROBIN-ROBERTS-@1-A# @(Voiceover) Nancy assumed that filing for divorce would end her troubles , but as it turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably have two or 300 emails that are very abusive , and it got uglier and uglier. @!ROBIN-ROBERTS-@1-A# @(Voiceover) In one disturbing email , Shenkman wrote , " This divorce is going places you 've never seen . I 've got nothing to lose that I care about , so I will risk it all . " He also left her vicious and taunting voice mails. @!RICHARD-SHENKMAN-@# You coward . You ( censored by network ) coward . You can only get your divorce in one way , and that 's death . We 're all going down in flames . I 'm gon na destroy your life . @!ROBIN-ROBERTS-@1-A# @(Voiceover) Nancy says Shenkman began stalking her , sitting outside her gym , taking pictures of her . And that was n't all he took . @GRAPHICS @GRAPHICS @!TAKEN-# @!NANCY-TYLER-@1RICH# There were times when I would go to the gym and he would take my car . @!ROBIN-ROBERTS-@1-A# @(Off-camera) How did he get your car ? @!NANCY-TYLER-@1RICH# Because he had keys to the car because - they were cars we had had as a married couple . @!ROBIN-ROBERTS-@1-A# @(Voiceover) Nancy had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have Shenkman arrested , but the harassment escalated . @!NANCY-TYLER-@1RICH# Our divorce became the war of the Tylers . One of the very first things he did was send me an email to say , " You need to get new shoes . " The husband in that movie cuts off the heels on all of the shoes belonging to his wife . It was always , this is going to end up the way the movie ended . @!ROBIN-ROBERTS-@1-A# @(Voiceover) But unlike " The War of the Roses , " Nancy was not forced to share a roof with her soon-to-be ex-husband . She was living at their beach house and had just arrived at work one morning when she received a chilling phone call . @!NANCY-TYLER-@1RICH# A friend of mine called me , " You know , you better turn on the news because there 's a house on fire in Niantic , and I think it might be yours . " So I drove down here . And the beach house was just engulfed in flames from top to bottom , and it was completely burned to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything , and Shenkman was arrested for arson . @!ROBIN-ROBERTS-@1-A# @(Off-camera) You see your home and everything you own burnt , and most people think that 's bad , and that 's as bad as it 's gon na get in a divorce . @!NANCY-TYLER-@1RICH# I thought he would do something , but I never thought it would go the way it went . @!ROBIN-ROBERTS-@1-A# @(Voiceover) After three painful years , Nancy 's divorce from Richard Shenkman was nearly over . On July 7th , 2009 , they were due in court for what Nancy hoped would be the last time . Unable to sleep , she left for work at dawn . But when she arrived at her office , she was startled to see Shenkman 's car parked outside . @!NANCY-TYLER-@1RICH# I telephoned a friend on my cell phone and said , " You know , something 's kind of funny here . " @!SUSANNE-ARNOLD-@1F# And she told me that she saw Richard 's van parked on the street , but she did n't see any sign of Richard . @!NANCY-TYLER-@1RICH# It was dark . There was nobody there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The last person I expected to see was him . @!SUSANNE-ARNOLD-@1F# And then in the course of the conversation , all of a sudden , she screamed , " Richard , get away from me. " @!NANCY-TYLER-@1RICH# And he came at me and showed me a gun . I had the phone in my hand , and I said to my friend ... @!SUSANNE-ARNOLD-@1F# " Susanne , call the police . " @!NANCY-TYLER-@1RICH# " He 's here . He 's got a gun . " @!SUSANNE-ARNOLD-@1F# And then the phone went dead . @!NANCY-TYLER-@1RICH# And he struggled for the phone and he got it away from me and said , " Get in the car . " @!ROBIN-ROBERTS-@1-A# @(Voiceover) Susanne dialed 911 to report Nancy 's abduction . @!SUSANNE-ARNOLD-@1F# She 's on the street . He came up to her . I could hear his voice in the background and she said , " Susanne , call the police . " @!ROBIN-ROBERTS-@1-A# @(Off-camera) Your heart must have been racing . @!SUSANNE-ARNOLD-@1F# I was frightened for her , very frightened . I knew , I felt that Richard was capable of absolutely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shenkman was really capable of would shock everyone . @!RICHARD-SHENKMAN-@# I 'm leaving this property in a body bag . @!ROBIN-ROBERTS-@1-A# @(Voiceover) " 12 Hours of Terror " ... @!RICHARD-SHENKMAN-@# Yeah , you got till nine ... @!KRISTA-MARCHESSEAU# Richard . @!RICHARD-SHENKMAN-@# Do n't try to talk to me. @!KRISTA-MARCHESSEAU# I know . I know . @!NANCY-TYLER-@1RICH# Please , please . @!KRISTA-MARCHESSEAU# Okay . I know , Nancy . I know . @!ROBIN-ROBERTS-@1-A# @(Voiceover) ... " Caught on Tape , " when " 20/20 " returns . @!COMMERCIAL-BREAK-@# @!ANNOUNCER-# " Taken : 12 Hours of Terror Caught on Tape . " Once again , Robin Roberts . @!ROBIN-ROBERTS-@1-A# @(Voiceover) Nancy Tyler had been kidnapped at gunpoint by her ex-husband . But just seconds before he grabbed her , she managed to call for help . @!CHIEF-MATTHEW-REED# On this particular morning , we received a call from the city of Hartford . And they told us that they were investigating a possible kidnapping . @!ROBIN-ROBERTS-@1-A# @(Voiceover) Matthew Reed is the chief of police in South Windsor , Connecticut , a rural suburb where Nancy had lived for 12 years with her ex-husband , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so we really needed to find out what was going on . @!ROBIN-ROBERTS-@1-A# @(Voiceover) In a stroke of luck , Shenkman had forgotten to turn off Nancy 's cell phone . By triangulating its signal , police hope to learn where he was taking her . @!CHIEF-MATTHEW-REED# And we 're able to track its location , and that it was within about two miles of the South Windsor police station . @!ROBIN-ROBERTS-@1-A# @(Voiceover) Sergeant Pete Alix , a 22-year veteran of the South Windsor police , was on duty that morning . @!SERGEANT-PETER-ALI# We had the vehicle description , plate number , pretty much everyone that 's in the building emptied out to go see if we could find this vehicle . @!ROBIN-ROBERTS-@1-A# @(Voiceover) Meanwhile , a terrified Nancy drove with Shenkman behind her , his gun pointed at her back . @!NANCY-TYLER-@1RICH# He did n't talk . He sat behind me . I could see him in the rearview mirror . He just said , " Shut up and drive . " @!ROBIN-ROBERTS-@1-A# @(Voiceover) It was n't long before Nancy realized that he was taking her back to their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very clear that Shenkman had prepared for this day . @!NANCY-TYLER-@1RICH# He had a big duffel bag on the counter of the kitchen . And he pulled his handcuffs out . And he said , " Put these on . " He brought me into the living room and I saw that there were monitors set up . And he turned them all on and we could see the outside of the house . And he started talking about " they 're gon na be here soon . " @!ROBIN-ROBERTS-@1-A# @(Voiceover) It was 10:45 in the morning when the first police officer arrived at the house . Then in a surprising move , Shenkman called 911. @!KRISTA-MARCHESSEAU# South Windsor police dispatcher Marchesseault. @!RICHARD-SHENKMAN-@# Get all the police officers off of 96 Tumblebrook Drive right now . @!KRISTA-MARCHESSEAU# Okay . Who is this that 's calling ? @!RICHARD-SHENKMAN-@# I 've got hostages , and this house is wired for explosives . There is n't anything around this house that 's gon na survive . @!ROBIN-ROBERTS-@1-A# @(Voiceover) 911 dispatcher Krista Marchesseault. @!KRISTA-MARCHESSEAU# He told me that he had Nancy there and that everybody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it booby-trapped , he had explosives , he had cameras all around and could see everybody . @!RICHARD-SHENKMAN-@# What 's going on in the ( censored by network ) backyard ? Tell them to get the ( censored by network ) out of the yard . You got to understand , you know ? You 're not in charge . I 'm in charge . This is gon na be a situation that nobody 's been trained for because I 'm in charge . @!NANCY-TYLER-@1RICH# He got the police dispatcher and laid out the ground rules that he was in charge and they were gon na do what he said or someone was going to die . @!RICHARD-SHENKMAN-@# We 're gon na have some fun here . I hope somebody has a sense of humor here because there 's got to be humor in death . @!ROBIN-ROBERTS-@1-A# @(Voiceover) Within minutes , police SWAT teams arrived , disrupting the peaceful neighborhood . @!SERGEANT-PETER-ALI# He had blocked a lot of the windows with , by either drawing the drapes , drawing the shades . He had attempted to block our view into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as the police began surrounding the house . @!RICHARD-SHENKMAN-@# Every officer that steps foot on this property has to understand it 's a suicide mission . I 'm leaving this property in a body bag . How many other body bags are needed , that 's gon na be determined by how stupid you are . @!NANCY-TYLER-@1RICH# When they showed up , he got upset and said , " It 's too soon . I 'm not ready . " Was screaming at them , saying , " She 's here , and I 've got a gun to her head . And if you do n't do what I say , she 's gon na die . " And they , they did what he said . @!ROBIN-ROBERTS-@1-A# @(Voiceover) Shenkman had a list of 12 demands , threatening to kill Nancy and blow up the house , if they were not met . Among them were a marriage license , a judge and a priest . @!RICHARD-SHENKMAN-@# I want a marriage license . My wife and I wan na get remarried . @!ROBIN-ROBERTS-@1-A# @(Off-camera) Did he really think that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you 're being held at gunpoint . He 's forcing you . @!NANCY-TYLER-@1RICH# I do n't know . I do n't believe he had any feelings left for me or for anybody . It was something to make the police do to demonstrate that he was in control . When that did n't work , when they did not get the judge or the priest , then he lost it again . @!ROBIN-ROBERTS-@1-A# @(Voiceover) Shenkman 's frustration with the police had terrifying consequences for Nancy . @!NANCY-TYLER-@1RICH# I had my head on the desk , the gun at my temple , and his finger on the trigger . And he was doing the countdown . Screaming at the police on the phone that if they did n't do what he said by the time he counted to 10 , he was going to pull the trigger . @!RICHARD-SHENKMAN-@# One , two , three , scream at them . @!NANCY-TYLER-@1RICH# Please make him stop . @!RICHARD-SHENKMAN-@# Four , five ... @!NANCY-TYLER-@1RICH# @(Inaudible) @!KRISTA-MARCHESSEAU# Richard , listen . @!RICHARD-SHENKMAN-@# ... six ... @!KRISTA-MARCHESSEAU# Listen .

Okay . @!RICHARD-SHENKMAN-@# You 're gon na ( censored by network ) with me. @!MIKE-THOMPSON-@1PO# No , I 'm not , Richard . You know I 'm not . @!RICHARD-SHENKMAN-@# Yeah , you are . You are . And you 're gon na have , you know , you 're gon na have dead people here . @!MIKE-THOMPSON-@1PO# No , we do n't want that . @!RICHARD-SHENKMAN-@# Well , I do n't believe that . @!MIKE-THOMPSON-@1PO# And I do n't think - I do n't think you really want it either . @!RICHARD-SHENKMAN-@# I 'm telling you , I 've got nothing to lose . @!ROBIN-ROBERTS-@1-A# @(Voiceover) Meanwhile , other police officers were discussing among themselves how best to negotiate with the raving gunman . @!POLICE-OFFICER-@1M# What 's , what 's the primary negotiator 's - what does he wan na do ? I mean , what ... @!OFFICER-BERNIE-HAL# We 're trying to just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just wants to run things all around like crazy . And , and that our issue is if we give him too much , he 's , he acts like he really wants to end this whole thing in not a peaceful manner . We 're really afraid of a murder-suicide here . @!ROBIN-ROBERTS-@1-A# @(Voiceover) And they had good reason to be afraid . When Shenkman felt police were stalling for time in meeting his demands , he would press a gun to Nancy 's head and start a countdown . @!RICHARD-SHENKMAN-@# One , two , three ... @!NANCY-TYLER-@1RICH# And he would get to six or seven , and they would do something that would appease him and make him stop . @!KRISTA-MARCHESSEAU# I do n't want you to count anymore , though , okay ? @!RICHARD-SHENKMAN-@# Yeah . Well , I 'm counting . You got till nine ... @!KRISTA-MARCHESSEAU# Richard . @!RICHARD-SHENKMAN-@# Do n't try to talk to me. @!KRISTA-MARCHESSEAU# I know .

I know . @!ROBIN-ROBERTS-@1-A# @(Off-camera) Your head is on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gon na count to 10 and pull the trigger ? @!NANCY-TYLER-@1RICH# Yeah . @!ROBIN-ROBERTS-@1-A# @(Off-camera) And he got as high as ... @!NANCY-TYLER-@1RICH# Six or seven . @!RICHARD-SHENKMAN-@# Five ... @!KRISTA-MARCHESSEAU# Richard , listen . @!NANCY-TYLER-@1RICH# Please make him stop . @!RICHARD-SHENKMAN-@# ... six ... @!KRISTA-MARCHESSEAU# Listen . Listen . @!RICHARD-SHENKMAN-@# ... seven ... @!ROBIN-ROBERTS-@1-A# @(Off-camera) What are you thinking ? @!NANCY-TYLER-@1RICH# I was terrified . @!KRISTA-MARCHESSEAU# Do you hear me ? Nancy , do you hear me ? @!NANCY-TYLER-@1RICH# Can you hear me ? He 's counting to 20. @!KRISTA-MARCHESSEAU# I understand that . @!NANCY-TYLER-@1RICH# In 20 , he 's gon na shoot me. @!KRISTA-MARCHESSEAU# Okay . Does he have a gun there ? @!NANCY-TYLER-@1RICH# He 's giving me another chance . @!KRISTA-MARCHESSEAU# Does he have a gun there , Nancy ? @!NANCY-TYLER-@1RICH# @(Inaudible) @!RICHARD-SHENKMAN-@# Wait , wait , wait . You ought to be in panic mode , lady . @!NANCY-TYLER-@1RICH# We had been through probably four countdowns by that time . And each time - I thought this was it . @!ROBIN-ROBERTS-@1-A# @(Voiceover) Nancy instinctively knew that in order to stay alive , she had to keep Shenkman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying to talk him down from the various rages that he had and dealing with things like when he gave me the rope to hold , that he said he was thinking about hanging me with and explaining to me how he had something set up to hang me if nothing else worked . @!RICHARD-SHENKMAN-@# You wan na grab that rope ? @!MIKE-THOMPSON-@1PO# What are you doing with the rope , Richard ? @!RICHARD-SHENKMAN-@# There 's gon na be a noose around my wife 's neck here . @!MIKE-THOMPSON-@1PO# And why do you wan na do that , Richard ? @!RICHARD-SHENKMAN-@# Well , because I got a contraption that she 's gon na sit on this little platform that I have that has remote control . @!NANCY-TYLER-@1RICH# He would calm down sometimes for a while , but they were just temporary calming periods , waiting for something else to happen . @!ROBIN-ROBERTS-@1-A# @(Voiceover) By 1:00 in the afternoon , in another act of shocking bravado , he called a local newspaper reporter Karen Florin . @!KAREN-FLORIN-@1 " TH# Wow , this guy 's got his wife at gunpoint and he 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call me ? @!RICHARD-SHENKMAN-@# I trust you . @!ROBIN-ROBERTS-@1-A# @(Voiceover) One of Florin 's colleagues at " The Day " newspaper began videotaping their conversation , one of four they would have that day . @!RICHARD-SHENKMAN-@# I do n't wan na take innocent people 's lives . @!KAREN-FLORIN-@1 " TH# Why are you having your wife there , ex-wife ? @!RICHARD-SHENKMAN-@# Because she had her head on my shoulder and I 've waited three years for that . And this is worth it . @!ROBIN-ROBERTS-@1-A# @(Off-camera) I 'm trying to imagine , he wants you to put your head on his shoulder . Is it an , an intimate moment ? Is he trying to recreate some kind of romance ? @!NANCY-TYLER-@1RICH# A lot of what I did that day was try to establish some kind of connection with him to make him realize that I was a human being . @!ROBIN-ROBERTS-@1-A# @(Voiceover) During the third call , Shenkman encouraged Nancy to speak to Florin . @!RICHARD-SHENKMAN-@# Whatever you wan na say , Nancy . I 'm not , I do n't want this to be that I 'm controlling you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either of us to be hurt . I want both of us to come through this and move on . @!ROBIN-ROBERTS-@1-A# @(Voiceover) But in his final phone call , there was a chilling reversal . Shenkman demanded the negotiators bring him a priest , not to marry them , but to administer last rites , something Florin knew police would never do . @!KAREN-FLORIN-@1 " TH# If you comply with that demand and come in and give somebody last rites , it 's almost like giving him permission to kill her . @!RICHARD-SHENKMAN-@# There 's nothing at risk to have a priest at the police station giving her last rites . @!KAREN-FLORIN-@1 " TH# I do n't understand why you want a priest to give her her last rites if you 're not gon na harm her . @!RICHARD-SHENKMAN-@# " Because they 're gon na harm her . They 're gon na do this . They 're gon na call my bluff . They 're gon na , they 're gon na storm the house . They 're not gon na let me continue this much longer . " And honestly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last conversation , hoping that he was n't gon na hurt her . @!NANCY-TYLER-@1RICH# I just kept thinking , is this gon na be the end ? Is this - is this the time he 's gon na actually pull the trigger ? @!ROBIN-ROBERTS-@1-A# @(Voiceover) 11 agonizing hours had passed for Nancy Tyler . @!NANCY-TYLER-@1RICH# I was on my last legs because it was emotionally exhausting . @!ROBIN-ROBERTS-@1-A# @(Voiceover) Handcuffed to the same man who was holding a gun to her head , Nancy made a last-ditch attempt to end her harrowing ordeal . @!NANCY-TYLER-@1RICH# I had actually grabbed for the gun . And he backhanded me . He knocked me to the floor . And I learned that was n't a wise move . He did n't kill me at that point . He did n't do anything other than hit me . But I did n't do that again . @!ROBIN-ROBERTS-@1-A# @(Voiceover) Outside , police were calculating their next move . @!CHIEF-MATTHEW-REED# A lot of it is a waiting game . We get the people in position tactically . We get a good view of the house . @!ROBIN-ROBERTS-@1-A# @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ police station . Late in the day , Shenkman called to tell them they should speak to Nancy one last time . @!MARILYN-COMEY-@1NA# My cell phone rang , and it was Richard . So I talked to him and to Nancy . She sounded horrible . But she said , " I 'm okay . " @!NANCY-TYLER-@1RICH# My whole family was waiting at the police station . And he had called a couple of times and allowed me to talk to my sister . @!ROBIN-ROBERTS-@1-A# @(Off-camera) Your children ? @!NANCY-TYLER-@1RICH# No. @!VICTORIA-@1NANCY-T# Just once . @!NANCY-TYLER-@1RICH# I do n't , I did ? @!VICTORIA-@1NANCY-T# Mm-hmm . @!NANCY-TYLER-@1RICH# Okay . @!VICTORIA-@1NANCY-T# We said goodbye . @!NANCY-TYLER-@1RICH# That 's one of those things I think I blanked out of my mind . @!PETER-@1NANCY-TYLE# And I was listening to her voice for the first time that day . She sounded frightened , and she sounded harried . And he was in the background , and she was trying to say goodbye to us and telling us that she loved us. @!VICTORIA-@1NANCY-T# They put my mother and Richard on speakerphone , and she said goodbye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her , and we told her to stay safe . And then he hung up on us. @!ROBIN-ROBERTS-@1-A# @(Voiceover) 12 hours into the siege , darkness was beginning to set in , and police decided to make a move . @!NANCY-TYLER-@1RICH# The police had a robot that they sent up the driveway . And that enraged him . And he started screaming at them on the phone to get the robot out of the yard , " Or she 's dead . " @!RICHARD-SHENKMAN-@# Get the robot and the phone off the steps . You have 20 seconds or she 's dead . @!NANCY-TYLER-@1RICH# He dragged me across the house and said , " We 're going in the basement . We 're going into the bunker . This is it . I 'm done with them . I 'm done with you . " And I started screaming at that point and I said , " I , I do n't , do n't make me go in the basement . I do n't wan na die in the basement .

What did he do ? @!COMMERCIAL-BREAK-# @!ROBIN-ROBERTS-@1-A# @(Voiceover) It was a scene not even Hollywood could have created , a hostage standoff , carried out by a man obsessed with the " The War of the Roses , " a film he used as a blueprint for torturing his ex-wife . @!CLIP-FROM- " THE-WAR# @!MICHAEL-DOUGLAS-@1# You will never get that house . @!ROBIN-ROBERTS-@1-A# @(Voiceover) Inside Shenkman 's house , he forced Nancy down the stairs and handcuffed her to an eyebolt he 'd screwed into the wall . @!NANCY-TYLER-@1RICH# He handed the phone to me and said , " Tell them . Tell them what 's going on . " @!NANCY-TYLER-@1RICH# I am handcuffed to a wall , handcuffed to a wall , and he 's got his gun to my head . @!NANCY-TYLER-@1RICH# The negotiator said to me , " Are you all right ?

I prayed for some dignity to get through whatever came next . @!ROBIN-ROBERTS-@1-A# @(Voiceover) But what came next caught Nancy by surprise . Shenkman turned and ran back up the basement stairs . It was the first time he had left her alone all day . @!NANCY-TYLER-@1RICH# I thought , this is it . I just got a chance and I 'm gon na take it . I 'd been trying to unscrew the bolt out of the wall , and I yanked it out the rest of the way . I ran out of the room , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Although Shenkman had warned her that he had rigged the doors to blow up if she attempted to escape , Nancy decided she had to risk it . In the backyard , SWAT team sniper Peter Alix had his rifle scope trained on the basement door . @!SERGEANT-PETER-ALI# And I look through the scope , and I see a woman coming out the basement door . I told my partner , I said , " There she is. " @!NANCY-TYLER-@1RICH# I open the door , I ran out across the yard , and I started to climb the fence . And one of the SWAT team fellows just appeared out of nowhere . @!SERGEANT-PETER-ALI# So she turned around , saw us , comes running over . I notice she was wearing a handcuff . I got on the radio , and I said , " We have the hostage in custody . " @!ROBIN-ROBERTS-@1-A# @(Voiceover) After 12 , terrifying hours , Nancy was finally free . But Shenkman was still holed up in the house with his gun . @!SERGEANT-PETER-ALI# At that point , our sniper team leader comes back over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down . " @!ROBIN-ROBERTS-@1-A# @(Voiceover) With Nancy out of harm 's way , the snipers no longer had the authority to shoot Shenkman on sight . But only seconds later , he ran out the basement door looking for her . When he saw police , he quickly turned and ran back inside . @!SERGEANT-PETER-ALI# Mr. Shenkman probably missed meeting his maker by about two seconds . It was a , a very narrow window that determined whether or not this guy was gon na go to trial or go to the mortuary . @!ROBIN-ROBERTS-@1-A# @(Voiceover) Nancy was taken to a local hospital where she was reunited with her children . @!VICTORIA-@1NANCY-T# There were so many emotions going on . I was so happy . But at the same time , I was so angry that Richard could have put our family through this . @!ROBIN-ROBERTS-@1-A# It 's kind of like emotional roulette that you went through . @!NANCY-TYLER-@1RICH# It was . It was . Because there - he had demonstrated he was willing to pull the trigger . I came out with a mark on my forehead from the barrel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on her forehead made me realize exactly how close - I came to losing her . @!ROBIN-ROBERTS-@1-A# @(Off-camera) You 're a brave woman . @!NANCY-TYLER-@1RICH# I do n't know if it 's brave or , or you do what you have to do . @!ROBIN-ROBERTS-@1-A# @(Off-camera) Mm-hmm . @!ROBIN-ROBERTS-@1-A# @(Voiceover) Back at the house , Shenkman was enraged , insisting to hostage negotiators that Nancy return or he would take his own life . @!RICHARD-SHENKMAN-@# Tell her I want her back if she wants to save my life . @!MIKE-THOMPSON-@1PO# Richard ... @!RICHARD-SHENKMAN-@# I am not coming out of this house . Now , I 'm ready to blow it up , but the only way I wo n't is if Nancy comes back and talks . @!ROBIN-ROBERTS-@1-A# @(Voiceover) Shenkman told police that he had 65 pounds of explosives in the house . @!RICHARD-SHENKMAN-@# You 're pissing me off . @!MIKE-THOMPSON-@1PO# I 'm trying to talk to you . @!RICHARD-SHENKMAN-@# I do n't give a ( censored by network ) if you yell .

They say , " We 're not fighting fire if somebody 's gon na be shooting at us. " @!ROBIN-ROBERTS-@1-A# @(Voiceover) As the house burned down around him , it appeared as though Shenkman had followed through on his final threat , destroying all that was left of his life with Nancy and killing himself in the process . @!SERGEANT-PETER-ALI# The house is burning . People are calling to him , getting no answer . About that time , we figured he must be dead . @!ROBIN-ROBERTS-@1-A# @(Voiceover) But remarkably , Shenkman survived . @!SERGEANT-PETER-ALI# We kind of figured , when it gets hot enough , he 'll come out . I would have to say 99% of the house had burned , and he ended up crawling out . @!ROBIN-ROBERTS-@1-A# @(Voiceover) With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's ordeal was finally over .

You 're not doing anything I ask you to . @!ROBIN-ROBERTS-@1-A# @(Voiceover) ... until Nancy incredibly escaped . At his trial last October in Hartford , Connecticut , Richard Shenkman was facing 90 years in prison for taking his ex-wife hostage in their family home . His lawyer , Hugh Keefe , presented an insanity defense . @!HUGH-KEEFE-@1RICHA# The insanity defense is a defense of last resort , first of all , for criminal defense lawyers . This was a really difficult sell , notwithstanding the fact that I personally thought Richard was , for a long time had a , had a problem . @!KAREN-FLORIN-@1 " TH# One of the most interesting portions of the trial , I think , was when they played the tapes of Richard with the police , all those conversations . @!RICHARD-SHENKMAN-@# You know , this is eight months of planning here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , most hostage things are reactionary . @!POLICE-OPERATOR-@1# Mm-hmm . Yeah , they are . You 're right . @!RICHARD-SHENKMAN-@# This one 's not . @!KAREN-FLORIN-@1 " TH# I also think it was fatal for him because no jury that heard that was going to find him not guilty of committing these crimes . @!ROBIN-ROBERTS-@1-A# @(Voiceover) After a three-week trial , it took the jury less than five hours to convict him on all counts . But it was n't over yet . Nancy and her family would face him one final time at his sentencing earlier this month . Nancy and her son , Peter , reading their victims impact statements , told the world what it would mean if Shenkman were ever to be released from jail . @!PETER-@1NANCY-TYLE# I have known Richard Shenkman since I was 3 years old . Until the day he threw us out of the house , I called him dad . Shenkman 's explosive and unpredictable anger will be forever a part of my childhood . But for , future generations of our family need not suffer the same abuse if he receives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to survive that day and everything that came before it . For Mr. Shenkman , this will never stop . @!ROBIN-ROBERTS-@1-A# @(Voiceover) And in a surprising twist that shocked even his own lawyer , Shenkman also made a statement . @!RICHARD-SHENKMAN-@# I view myself right now as a prisoner of war , a POW . In July 2006 , Nancy Tyler declared war . She fired the first shot in the famous war of the Tylers by filing for divorce . @!HUGH-KEEFE-@1RICHA# In over 40 years of practice , I have never seen a criminal defendant say anything like what I heard Richard say to Judge Dewey and the court . @!RICHARD-SHENKMAN-@# I feel it 's a waste of time for me to rot in a cage for the rest of my life without a purpose . Killing Nancy Tyler gives me that purpose . @!ROBIN-ROBERTS-@1-A# @(Voiceover) Incredibly , in open court , Shenkman threatened to kill Nancy , hatching an elaborate plot to hire a hit man from his prison cell . @!RICHARD-SHENKMAN-@# One lone , experienced , professional assassin has the green light from me to kill Connecticut 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've never seen a sentencing like that . And I 've been covering courts for quite sometime . @!RICHARD-SHENKMAN-@# Imagine my arrogance announcing to this court that I 'm paying a killer to gun down Nancy Tyler while I 'm chained in a maximum security prison . How delusional am I ? Nobody is gon na believe it . @!ROBIN-ROBERTS-@1-A# @(Voiceover) Judge Julia Dewey dismissed Shenkman 's claims of being a POW. @!JUDGE-JULIA-DEWEY-# Now , the reason you 're here today , Mr. Shenkman , is not because you 're a prisoner of war .

You 're here because of your own conduct and nothing more . @!ROBIN-ROBERTS-@1-A# @(Voiceover) The judge rendered her decision . @!JUDGE-JULIA-DEWEY-# For a total effective sentence of 70 years , one year mandatory minimum . @!ROBIN-ROBERTS-@1-A# @(Voiceover) 70 years in prison .

Nancy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She hopes that her experience can help women understand the consequences of staying in an abusive relationship . @!NANCY-TYLER-@1RICH# I really thought I could handle it , I could pacify him . But what I was really doing is just delaying the inevitable and maybe making it riskier for everybody . @!ROBIN-ROBERTS-@1-A# @(Voiceover) Nancy says that looking back , she wished she had reached out to friends and called the police more often . @!NANCY-TYLER-@1RICH# A lot of women think , " If I call , it 's gon na put him over the edge , and he will get worse . " @!ROBIN-ROBERTS-@1-A# @(Off-camera) Was that what you were thinking too ? @!NANCY-TYLER-@1RICH# Yes . @!ROBIN-ROBERTS-@1-A# @(Off-camera) But your advice to women now ? @!NANCY-TYLER-@1RICH# Call .

##4103513 @!NARRATOR-@1POLITIC# We all know about Solyndra , the White House e-mails , the FBI raids . Solyndra investors raised campaign money for Obama . The government gave Solyndra half a billion in taxpayer money , politics as usual . @GRAPHICS @!NARRATOR-@1POLITIC# Secretive oil billionaires attacking President Obama with ads fact-checkers say are not tethered to the facts , while independent watchdogs call this president 's record on ethics " unprecedented . " In America 's clean-energy industry , 2.7 million jobs and expanding rapidly , President Obama kept his promise to toughen ethics rules and strengthen America 's energy economy . @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) In some states , the general election ads have already begun . We 're going to get to that in a moment . But I 'm back here right now with our roundtable , still a lot to talk about on this Republican nomination fight . And , Amy Walter , I want to go to you . We were just talking about Florida . This has become something , I guess , of a must-win for Mitt Romney . One of the reasons it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whoever wins Florida , even if it 's by one vote , gets all the delegates . @!AMY-WALTER-@1-ABC-# @(Off-camera) That 's right , although , remember , we still are a long way from the 1,044 that we need to get to , to win this nomination . Listen , I think the Florida model traditionally has been - well , it 's a big state . You spend a lot of money . That 's how you can win the state . And so Mitt Romney then goes in with an advantage . There are absentee ballots that he 's been organizing. @!AMY-WALTER-@1-ABC-# @(Off-camera) He 's been doing all the things traditional frontrunners do , except for the fact that we have two debates before those primary ballots are cast on the 31st . We have one on Monday , and we have another one on Thursday . So we go back to where we started this whole conversation , which is the role of debates in shaping these elections . So there - you 're coming off of a big win if you 're Newt Gingrich , but Newt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - the issue here - there 's still a lot of baggage here that Newt Gingrich has yet to deal with , and that ... @!MATTHEW-DOWD-@1-AB# @(Off-camera) But George , I think - in order for Mitt Romney to win Florida at this point , and he was ahead , I think by Tuesday - the race will be tied in Florida by Tuesday . And if - I did a little math last night , and people say , well , Florida 's different than South Carolina . If you take the demographics and say Newt Gingrich gets exactly what he did in South Carolina , among the same demographics he wins by 6 to 8 points in Florida . So in order - Mitt Romney has to change the dynamics of this race . @!AMY-WALTER-@1-ABC-# @(Off-camera) That 's right ... @!RON-BROWNSTEIN-@1E# But having said that , I mean , Florida is constituted more favorably to Romney than South Carolina . And the Republican Party , if you look at it nationally , as we were saying , it divides about in half now between an upscale , economically focused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ downscale , populist , evangelical wing . South Carolina clearly tilted toward the populist side . Two-thirds of the voters almost were born-again Christians . In Florida , it 's only two-fifths . About 60% are those non-evangelicals . And Romney did , we should note , still win them in South Carolina , non-evangelicals , despite one of the worst weeks that anybody has ever had . So there is still a foundation , but clearly it 's cracking . @!KATRINA-VANDEN-HEU# Now , these candidates , who are all across entitlements - and Mitt Romney 's signature issue is attacking Obama for his entitlement society - I think forget that Social Security and Medicare are entitlements . I think they 're rights . They 're coming into Florida , where I suspect there are millions of Americans , including Republicans , as polls show , who do n't want their entitlements taken away . @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) But they wo n't get ... @!MATTHEW-DOWD-@1-AB# You know , but the debate - could I just come back to what Amy said , though , because we 've been having a spirited debate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ debates have mattered in this election , which is great . They would matter a lot more if we did n't see those shadowy Super PAC kind of ads , which , on the second anniversary of Citizens United , have to remember , they have been unleashed on our landscape in a way that has taken elections out of the hands of ordinary people and put them into ... @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) No , let me make a point here , because one of the things we saw is that Newt Gingrich got hurt by the Super PAC ads in Iowa , but fought back in South Carolina and his Super PAC ads in South Carolina did n't ... @!KATRINA-VANDEN-HEU# But where are ordinary ... @!MATTHEW-DOWD-@1-AB# @(Off-camera) Listen , I take an entirely different view of this issue , a completely different view of this issue . I think everybody likes to say , " Wow , these Super PACs , all of this money out there , and all these ads out there , " they are very little effect in this race . Advertising - television advertising in presidential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diminished in importance . And ... @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) In the general election . @!MATTHEW-DOWD-@1-AB# @(Off-camera) In all elections . @!AMY-WALTER-@1-ABC-# @(Off-camera) In the general election . @!RON-BROWNSTEIN-@1E# I think it 's hard to argue it did n't matter in Iowa in the primary . @!MATTHEW-DOWD-@1-AB# @(Off-camera) Barack Obama outspent Hillary Clinton in Pennsylvania , Ohio , and Texas 3-to-1 on television ads and lost all three . @!KATRINA-VANDEN-HEU# This is the Ground Zero year for Citizens United . @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) George , you know , we 're now looking at this - you know , you look at history . Every Republican who 's gotten the nomination , every Democrat faces one bad week where they just get trounced . And the question is do they come back from it ? Or do they start to bleed in a way they ca n't control ? What do you think has happened to Mitt Romney here ? @!GEORGE-WILL-@1-ABC# @(Off-camera) I think it 's better to have your bad week now than later . It 's good to have a bad week , because you find out how tough you are and who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I think there 's a reason you play spring training games . This is still spring training . So I think this on balance is not - is far from fatal , and probably will be looked back upon by Mitt Romney as a toughening experience . @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) Is he still the frontrunner ? @!RON-BROWNSTEIN-@1E# Yes , I think he 's still the frontrunner , given all of his assets . But as I said , if Gingrich can find the wherewithal to organize the coalition that is around him , that coalition is large enough to contest this for a long time , because like Obama -Clinton , you have two wings of the party that seem now - that seem to have settled on a champion . @!RON-BROWNSTEIN-@1E# But , actually , real quick , to your point about Medicare , I was at a Newt Gingrich event Friday in Orangeburg , South Carolina . He was asked about Medicare and what he was going to do to strengthen it by an older woman . And older whites are also now over 63% Republican in 2010 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he would convert the program into a premium support or voucher program ... @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) Which is his plan . @!RON-BROWNSTEIN-@1E# Which is his plan . So they 're not entirely sold that they can sell this , either . @!AMY-WALTER-@1-ABC-# @(Off-camera) I just want to bring up two issues , two points about Newt and his baggage . The first is , when we asked this question in the last ABC- " Washington Post " poll about a week ago , 23% of voters said they definitely wo n't vote for Newt Gingrich , definitely wo n't vote for him . The only person who had a higher number than that was Ron Paul at 26% , Mitt Romney down at 8% . So there is a core of Republican voters who are saying this ... @!MATTHEW-DOWD-@1-AB# @(Off-camera) George ... @!AMY-WALTER-@1-ABC-# @(Off-camera) And that 51% , though , also think that his past , whether he 's - as a historian or consultant is a problem . @!MATTHEW-DOWD-@1-AB# @(Off-camera) I want to go - take that one step - and begin to sort of say , where are you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the general election to me ? And the State of the Union , I think , is the beginning of the start of the real general election campaign in this race . @!MATTHEW-DOWD-@1-AB# @(Off-camera) To me , this Republican primary and Newt Gingrich 's support is reflective of a broad anxiety going on in society , which people haven no idea what the future looks like and how to get there . And unless you present a vision of the future and how to get there , which the President has not done well and he might do , unless you present it , you 're open to people saying , " We need to go backwards . " And what Newt Gingrich has said - there was a time in America that gives you comfort and gives you a sense of warmth . Let 's go back . Because without a vision for the future ... @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) That 's true , but let me focus the question first on these primaries , because you bring up all the points that Amy just raises . Newt Gingrich has a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Republicans who think , flat out , he can not be the nominee of the party , yet Mitt Romney ca n't seem to get the love . So does that lead to a kind of situation where , as the former Republican Party Chairman Michael Steele said just yesterday , a 50-50 chance of a brokered convention ? @!MATTHEW-DOWD-@1-AB# @(Off-camera) Well , I think what happens - I think that is a little bit of a fiction , because what 's going to happen is , is Newt Gingrich and Mitt Romney are going to pick up the vast majority of the delegates . And it 's not like somebody can come into the process and say well you have ... @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) Ron Paul is going to stick in there taking up delegates as well . @!MATTHEW-DOWD-@1-AB# @(Off-camera) And you have a bunch of delegates , and you have a bunch of delegates , you do n't deserve to be president . @!RON-BROWNSTEIN-@1E# The process tends to consolidate . @!KATRINA-VANDEN-HEU# Consolidate . @!RON-BROWNSTEIN-@1E# The process - you know , and Rick Santorum - like many previous candidates who were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're kind of like Bruce Willis in " The Sixth Sense . " I mean , they 're kind of dead , but they 're the only one who does n't realize it . You know , it 's very hard to see ... @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) He seemed pretty buoyant this morning . @!RON-BROWNSTEIN-@1E# You know , he does . And he will . And he can get his 15% or 20% . But it 's hard to see what would allow him now to leapfrog back over Gingrich and become the dominant choice for conservatives looking for an alternative . @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) You saw Bill Kristol in the Weekly Standard saying maybe a draft for someone else . Is that out of the question ? @!GEORGE-WILL-@1-ABC# @(Off-camera) Probably . We have n't had a second ballot at a Republican convention since , what , ' 52 ? @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) ' 77 , right ? @!GEORGE-WILL-@1-ABC# @(Off-camera) No ... @!MATTHEW-DOWD-@1-AB# @(Off-camera) ' 52. @!GEORGE-WILL-@1-ABC# @(Off-camera) ' 52 . In 1976 , you had something like a convention that was on its eve at least a deliberative body ... @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) Gerald @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ratifying body . But with a proliferation of primaries , it 's very hard to believe someone is n't going to get 1,144 delegates and win . @!AMY-WALTER-@1-ABC-# @(Off-camera) And there 's - remember , we talked a lot about momentum in this and debates and fuel the oxygen for these candidates . Once Florida 's over , we go to Nevada , and then we have this big gap . We have some caucuses in between there , but we have a big gap . The month of February ... @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) Once you get into Arizona at the end of the month . @!AMY-WALTER-@1-ABC-# @(Off-camera) They 're at the end of the month ... @!RON-BROWNSTEIN-@1E# Arizona , Michigan at the end ... @!AMY-WALTER-@1-ABC-# @(Off-camera) And only one other debate scheduled , scheduled after January 31st. @!MATTHEW-DOWD-@1-AB# @(Off-camera) Newt will look to change that dynamic . @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) I want to pick up on what you were saying , Matthew Dowd . You talked about the State of the Union . Let me bring this to you , Katrina . The President is going to lay out what he called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for how to get jobs . It 's also going to be the first blueprint of his presidential campaign . @!KATRINA-VANDEN-HEU# Yes . @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) What do you expect to hear ? What do you want to hear ? @!KATRINA-VANDEN-HEU# I expect to hear - and I want to hear - themes that he sounded in his speech at the end of last year in Kansas , where he spoke about how this is a make-or-break moment for the middle class in this country , and began to lay out a blueprint for how we build a different economy and a vision for this country that is one that is forward-looking , that is tackling not just the fundamental income inequality - that , again , movements have brought to the fore - but lays out a vision for a different economy , one that is not about crony capitalism , but is about a Democratic capitalism that lifts all boats . @!KATRINA-VANDEN-HEU# And I think Matt is right that we 're looking at a debate and a campaign and an election that could be about two fundamentally different visions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take this country back , literally peddling recycled policies that brought us to the financial crisis we 're still living through , millions living in economic trouble and pain ... @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) George Will ? @!KATRINA-VANDEN-HEU# The President needs to speak to that and lay out a vision . @!GEORGE-WILL-@1-ABC# @(Off-camera) When Barack Obama comes out against crony capitalism , his slogan will be , what , " No More Solyndras " ? I want to hear that . @!KATRINA-VANDEN-HEU# We need an industrial policy not for the energy oil companies , but for green energy , George . @!GEORGE-WILL-@1-ABC# @(Off-camera) I would expect him to do several things . First , I think he 'll steal a plank of Mitt Romney 's campaign by attacking China as a currency manipulator . Second , he has to choose sooner or later , and he might do it Tuesday night , do taxes on millionaires and billionaires - his favorite trope - begin with couples earning a quarter of a million dollars , $250,000 ? It used to be his position . We 'll see what it is . But most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his impatience with our constitutional system . He 's going to say we ca n't wait , we ca n't wait for concurrent majorities in the Senate and the House and the President and the Supreme Court . We have to somehow override the Madisonian structure of our Constitution . @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) And , Ron Brownstein , is that enough for him , given the fact that this is probably the most unpopular Congress in the history of America ? @!RON-BROWNSTEIN-@1E# Yeah . @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) Or does that come back and blow back on him , people blame him for making - for not making the system work ? @!RON-BROWNSTEIN-@1E# Well , I think all indications are that at the core of the speech will be kind of a follow-up to the Osawatomie , Kansas , speech , and ... @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) The President said it . @!RON-BROWNSTEIN-@1E# And it will be kind of an economic populism that will contrast I think very sharply - you 'll have a general election in which you will have the core economic populist argument versus the core cultural populist argument that Republicans like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more muted if it 's Romney , but nonetheless , you know , elites in Washington trying to run your life or it 's economic elites who are giving you the shaft . And I will say to you now , I think it will give you a great , fundamental debate about the role of government , but it will not decide the election in the end , because those last 10% of voters who tip these things tend not to see the world in those kind of ideological terms . Even in the fall they do n't want to hear it . @!MATTHEW-DOWD-@1-AB# @(Off-camera) The real test of Barack Obama 's successes that we 've seen in the course of his presidency has never been , can he give a good speech at a good moment ? And it 's always been , can he give a good speech at the right moment , saying a projected vision forward , and then sticking with the message consistently for a period of time so the American people gets what he 's saying ? What normally has done , give big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on to something else . @!RON-BROWNSTEIN-@1E# And he 's kind of sticking with this . I mean , they are kind of sticking with the Osawatomie message . @!MATTHEW-DOWD-@1-AB# @(Off-camera) Well , as of right now . @!KATRINA-VANDEN-HEU# You know , one thing that gets lost in all of this is that the ball and chain on our economy remains the housing crisis . And the President , I hope , will not cut a sweetheart deal with banks . One hopes in this speech - no , seriously - that he will lay out the need for a fair investigation of the bank fraud that contributed to this housing crisis , because without a revival of housing - and there are 10 million more foreclosures ... @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) Or will he force more of them to write down more mortgages , that 's the other big question . @!KATRINA-VANDEN-HEU# But write down the - he needs to put together - he needs to call for a settlement ... @!MATTHEW-DOWD-@1-AB# @(Off-camera) The President 's credibility on this is so diminished . He 's got a chief of staff that worked at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Bain Capital . He 's taken more money from Goldman Sachs than any candidate in the history of the United States . And he 's going to give his nomination speech at Bank of America Field . @!KATRINA-VANDEN-HEU# At Bank of America ... @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) That is ... @!KATRINA-VANDEN-HEU# That is why - that is why we need to take money out - that 's why so many millions of people feel this government is rigged against them . That 's why we need to get the money out of the system from both parties . @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) All those points are true , but , Amy Walter , on the other hand , he 's coming into the chamber at a time , facing an unpopular Congress , when there is a fair amount of good economic news at his back , at least the beginnings of it . @!AMY-WALTER-@1-ABC-# @(Off-camera) That is true . But I do think that the frustration that most Americans are feeling goes back to the point that they want to see somebody who 's going to do what he says he 's going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't just say that he 's going to transcend all of this . They want to see some actual - something that 's really coming back for them , to them . They want to see somebody who looks more like a commander-in-chief than a candidate , and that 's where I think . .. @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) You bring up an important - commander-in-chief . And this is something we actually have n't talked too much about yet , George Will . @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Voiceover) President Obama on the cover of " Time " magazine this week gives a foreign policy interview to Fareed Zakaria , says he ca n't wait for the debate with the Republicans , thinks their arguments are going to go away . @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) Is this going to be much of a factor in the general election at all ? @!GEORGE-WILL-@1-ABC# @(Off-camera) I do n't think so . In the first place - as I 'm sure Matt would agree - Americans and presidential politics really do n't want to think about foreign policy unless they 're forced to by bad news . @!MATTHEW-DOWD-@1-AB# @(Off-camera) They just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about it . @!GEORGE-WILL-@1-ABC# @(Off-camera) What they want of Iraq is out of Iraq . What they want about Afghanistan is out of Afghanistan . It 's pretty hard to look at what the President 's doing with drones and assassinating high-value targets and call him weak on this matter . @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) But it 's not a plus for him , you 're saying ? @!GEORGE-WILL-@1-ABC# @(Off-camera) It 's not a plus - well , it 's not a plus for him , but since 1968 , and the riotous Democratic convention , since the nomination of McGovern in 1972 , the Democratic Party has been perceived as problematic on national security . I think he is largely immunized on that . @!KATRINA-VANDEN-HEU# I was going to say that one thing we have n't talked about with these candidates , there 's very little daylight between a Gingrich , Romney , Santorum . They are all drum-beaters for a war with Iran . And I think - Bruce Laingen , who was held in the Iranian embassy in 1979 , asks , how could this country , which is trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this region , now contemplate heading into another war ? @!GEORGE-WILL-@1-ABC# @(Off-camera) Katrina , there is no difference whatever between Romney 's position on Iran and Leon Panetta's. @!KATRINA-VANDEN-HEU# I disagree . I disagree . @!RON-BROWNSTEIN-@1E# I think there 's a little ... @!KATRINA-VANDEN-HEU# No , you have around Romney the neo-cons who took us into these bloody misadventures ... @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) But he has n't gone as far as Rick Santorum talking about striking Iran . @!KATRINA-VANDEN-HEU# I mean I 'm not ... @!RON-BROWNSTEIN-@1E# I want to go back to your point from a moment ago , because I think it 's worth it more than in passing - you know , while we 're all so focused on the Republican race , the economic news that has come out in the last few months , if it 's sustained , may be shifting the ground overall in this race a little bit . Barack Obama was not Jimmy Carter or George HW Bush . He never fell out of contention , never fell into the 30s for any lasting period in his approval rating . He 's hanging around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he does get a little economic uplift , the terrain of November looks a lot different than we 're seeing right now . @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) I want to return that to Matthew Dowd , because this is where foreign policy and economics come together . When you talk about Iran , if you continue to tighten the sanctions , oil prices go up , and you 're facing $5 , $6-a-gallon gas in the summer . What does that mean ? @!MATTHEW-DOWD-@1-AB# @(Off-camera) Well , that 's the big - that 's the big problem , the question mark we have for Barack Obama . And you 're right . He has gotten - he 's not dropped below , but he 's not at a level he can get re-elected today . The problem is , if we look at the summer and the trajectory is up , he wins . If the trajectory is down , he loses . And it 's all driven to a large by Europe and what 's going on , on the global economy . And that 's what I think the Obama folks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what may happen this summer . @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) And the question is does he get a surprise ? Fifteen seconds , George . @!GEORGE-WILL-@1-ABC# @(Off-camera) They do in this sense . Saudi Arabia - diplomacy seems to be ready to supplement 2 million barrels a day to keep the prices down and arguably help re-elect Mr Obama. @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) That 'll be the last word . This was a fantastic roundtable . Thank you all very much . @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) And coming up , it was 12 years ago that George W Bush famously accused Al Gore of practicing fuzzy math . John Berman on how some things in politics never change . @!GEORGE-W-BUSH-@1FO# This is a man , he 's got great numbers . He talks about numbers . I 'm beginning to think not only did he invent the Internet , but he invented the calculator . It 's fuzzy math . COMMERCIAL BREAK ' 
##4103514 @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) And with that , let 's get straight to our roundtable . I am joined , as always , by George Will , Katrina vanden Heuvel of " The Nation " magazine , ABC 's Matthew Dowd , and Amy Walter over here on my right , editorial director of the " National Journal , " Ron Brownstein. @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) And let 's get right to it , George . Boy , what a difference a week makes . Last Sunday , Mitt Romney looking to do something never been done in Republican primaries , get a clean sweep , three in a row . This week , something else we have n't seen before , three primaries and caucuses , three winners . @!GEORGE-WILL-@1-ABC# @(Off-camera) Yes , the old pattern has now been broken , and that is , for five consecutive times - beginning with Reagan in 1980 - Candidate A wins Iowa , Candidate B wins New Hampshire , and either A or B wins South Carolina and the nomination . That 's over . Mitt Romney 's going-in trump card was electability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ primary , he 's been in 25 races , his record is 6 wins and 19 losses . @!RON-BROWNSTEIN-@1E# Like the Red Sox in September , actually , it 's very New England . @!GEORGE-WILL-@1-ABC# @(Off-camera) Newt Gingrich won , it seems , at least 43 of 46 counties . He carried women and evangelical conservative South Carolina . He carried evidently all seven congressional districts . So here 's what we now know . We all thought going in that the big problem for Romney might be his Mormonism . It might be the Massachusetts health care plan . That 's not it . Mitt Romney 's problem is somehow his Romney-Ness , that is the fact that people are just not connecting with him , not just that he 's the first candidate we 've ever had from the financial sector , which turns out to be a problem , because finance is , A , mysterious and , B , disliked , but there 's something about him that is not connecting . @!MATTHEW-DOWD-@1-AB# @(Off-camera) I think the most - the most consistent thing in this inconsistent race @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself in this race . He came in this race as the establishment candidate . He came in this race that most people thought was the odds-on favorite . He came in this race , as we 've presented argument , with the best organization , best campaign , and best money . And as we 've seen this entire process unfold , the problem has been - maybe not his Romney-Ness , but maybe his Mitt-Ness , because he can not sell himself as an authentic , competent conservative in this field . And now he 's back to - we thought they broke the lid . He 's back to the 28% , 25% . And that 's a huge problem . And it 's going be a huge problem in Florida . @!KATRINA-VANDEN-HEU# He 's bleeding , because he has not been able to deal with the tax issue , with the fundamental unfairness that he is an MRI of , and so amateurish . But George mentioned that we 're seeing old patterns or we are n't seeing old patterns . I think we 're seeing some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think we now have the surge of a street fighter with a history of poisonous politics . And we heard very clearly in these debates in South Carolina a replay of a 2012 version of Nixon 's Southern strategy , this playing on the racial grievances and resentments , attacking a mythic liberal media , attacking now Obama 's otherness . This is very dangerous for the country . And I know some Democrats are cheering because Newt Gingrich has historically unfavorably high ratings , but you have a party taking this country into an abyss of poisonous grievances , when this country desperately needs solutions to economic problems ... @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) Those Democrats include those in the White House looking for Newt Gingrich . They do want him . @!KATRINA-VANDEN-HEU# ... of this country . @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) But you - you brought up two points that really harken - a big thing that led to Newt 's surge this week , two debate moments . And I want to show both of them , and then we can talk about it . The first one , when he got into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Newt 's talk about food stamps was insulting to African-Americans. @!JUAN-WILLIAMS-@1FO# It sounds as if you 're seeking to belittle people . @!NEWT-GINGRICH-@1RE# Well , first of all , Juan , the fact is that more people have been put on food stamps by Barack Obama than any president in American history . @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) And then the night of " Nightline 's " interview with his former wife , Marianne Gingrich , Newt Gingrich in Thursday 's debate goes right after John King of CNN . @!NEWT-GINGRICH-@1RE# I think the destructive , vicious , negative nature of much of the news media makes it harder to govern this country , harder to attract decent people to run for public office , and I am appalled that you would begin a presidential debate on a topic like that . @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) And , Ron , we 've been talking a lot about Mitt Romney , but we also saw this week in South Carolina the debates mattered a lot . @!RON-BROWNSTEIN-@1E# We saw the conservative opportunity in Newt Gingrich from the 1970s , he was a back-bencher at the far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talking in very vitriolic language to get noticed . Look , the formula that had been working for Mitt Romney until now was divide and conquer . In Iowa , New Hampshire , in the national polling , he was consolidating the center of the party behind him more than anyone was consolidating the right of the party against him . That has now broken down . @!RON-BROWNSTEIN-@1E# If you look in South Carolina , evangelical Christians , strong Tea Party supporters , very conservative , voters under 50,000 and non-college Republicans , all strands of what could be called the populist wing of the Republican Party , Newt Gingrich got up to 40% among them by articulating , I think , that kind of core anger they feel at both Washington and elites in general . And that 's a much higher number than anybody was able to get in Iowa or New Hampshire among those voters . @!RON-BROWNSTEIN-@1E# And so the risk that Romney is facing is that , even with Santorum in there peeling away a part of that vote , that you now have this kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gingrich , Romney is still pretty strong in that managerial , upscale side of the party , but this is a race that could go a long way if Gingrich has the financial and organizational resources to harvest it . @!AMY-WALTER-@1-ABC-# @(Off-camera) Right , and that 's - he has to have that . He also has to have the discipline . I mean , there is a reason that Rick Santorum came in and called him erratic and he called him a high-risk candidate , right ? @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) High risk . @!AMY-WALTER-@1-ABC-# @(Off-camera) Because what we 've seen - while I think it 's true that Mitt Romney has had a problem really being able to be consistent from , from debate to debate , from primary to primary , so have his opponents . That 's why we 've had three different winners . And I think Newt has to do that , as well , if he 's going to survive . @!AMY-WALTER-@1-ABC-# @(Off-camera) The other issue here , when we come to the issue of Bain Capital , and - and the financial sector , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you know , it reminds of - it 's not the crime , it 's the cover-up , right ? And that the issue is n't Bain . It 's his believability , the believability on the tax issue , the believability that he can go up against Barack Obama and defend who he is . And that 's where his real problem is , because ... @!KATRINA-VANDEN-HEU# I think it 's the ... @!AMY-WALTER-@1-ABC-# @(Off-camera) ... it went to that wishy-washiness. @!KATRINA-VANDEN-HEU# I think the issue is not Mitt Romney . I think , again , coming back to saying - this campaign is giving us an MRI of the fundamental unfairness of the system in this country , and the impact of Occupy Wall Street and the 99% , and the idea that income inequality and fairness has emerged as a central theme has brought Romney 's problems - his father - never forget his father , who filed 12 tax returns in 1967 , paid a 37% federal income tax rate . We see the descent D-E-S-C-E-N-T of our tax system and the unfairness . And even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the issue as much as it is his answers on it . @!MATTHEW-DOWD-@1-AB# @(Off-camera) Let 's go back to the debates and go back to what we see in this process to me . While there 's been - people have seen some troubling nature of it and some ways they 've said - I think there 's actually - in my vantage point , some great developments that we 've seen in this process that we 've not seen before . @!MATTHEW-DOWD-@1-AB# @(Off-camera) First , debates matter . And that is a big difference in - it used to be I 'm going to buy a bunch of media , I 'm going to pay a bunch of people , and therefore , I 'm not going to have to have a conversation . So debates matter , because people are looking for an authentic conversation in this environment , which they do n't feel they 've had before . Second , the idea that you can go out and write checks to consultants and all that and hire media folks and pay for organizations ... @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) Newt fired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them all . And then we 've seen the ones that have had the most of it have n't been the most successful in this . Rick Santorum wins Iowa with basically no paid organization and no money on television . @!GEORGE-WILL-@1-ABC# @(Off-camera) That saying - debates , however , deserves a minor dissent . Conservatives and Republicans generally are saying let 's nominate Newt because for four-and-a-half hours of debates with Barack Obama , he 'd be the best . You 're talking about giving a guy nuclear weapons for eight years perhaps . @!MATTHEW-DOWD-@1-AB# @(Off-camera) Actually , I do n't think that 's why they 're saying that . What - what I think they 're saying is - what the voters want is a strong , decisive , authentic conservative . And what , what Newt Gingrich has revealed - and whether he 's in - his entirety of his life is true or not - what he 's revealed in the course of the debates and what Mitt Romney has shown is that Mitt Romney has shown is he 's not a strong , decisive , authentic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the folks in the debate . @!RON-BROWNSTEIN-@1E# But what Gingrich has been is not ideologically consistent through his career , but he has been consistently a partisan warrior . The Gingrich you saw on stage this week was the Gingrich who called the Clintons the enemy of normal Americans in the ' 90s or the language he used about Jim Wright in the 1980s . And that is connecting with Republicans . @!RON-BROWNSTEIN-@1E# I will have a dissent , though , from Amy , because I think there is more - it 's not only Mitt Romney 's answers that are causing him the problems . The Republican Party is changing . It is becoming more blue collar , more downscale . They 're winning an awful lot of white working-class voters , and Romney has always had difficulty connecting with those - even in the first two states when he was doing well , he did much better among better educated and more affluent voters than he did with ... @!AMY-WALTER-@1-ABC-# @(Off-camera) So true . @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) So did Senator Barack Obama four years ago . @!RON-BROWNSTEIN-@1E# That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He is ... @!RON-BROWNSTEIN-@1E# As he moves forward , that constituency is very challenging for him . Newt Gingrich beat him by a substantial margin , 18 points , among voters without a college education in South Carolina . @!GEORGE-WILL-@1-ABC# @(Off-camera) Ron is pointing to the Republican base . In the 2010 elections , whites without college education , Republicans got 63% of that vote . @!RON-BROWNSTEIN-@1E# 63% , yeah . @!GEORGE-WILL-@1-ABC# @(Off-camera) And the question is - now , it 's not that Professor Obama is going to connect with those people any better than perhaps the man from Bain Capital , but the question is who , the answer is Newt is. @!MATTHEW-DOWD-@1-AB# @(Off-camera) And that 's the thing about this ... @!RON-BROWNSTEIN-@1E# By what he 's saying ... @!MATTHEW-DOWD-@1-AB# @(Off-camera) This is why everybody thought oh , Newt Gingrich should n't be attacking Bain , he should n't be doing that , there 's going to be a bad reaction to it . It 's the people that still thought the Republican Party is based on Wall Street , when it 's based in rural America . @!KATRINA-VANDEN-HEU# @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting some news while we 're talking here ... @!KATRINA-VANDEN-HEU# Oh . @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) Mitt Romney seems to believe that it is his tax returns that are part of the issue . He has just announced this morning that he is going to release two years of tax returns this Tuesday , following Jeb Bush 's call for him to release them before Florida . And , Amy , this gets to the question I think a lot of us were mystified . You knew this question was coming all year long , yet you 've seen a series of four or five different answers from Mitt Romney . Now we know we 're going to see two years on Tuesday . @!AMY-WALTER-@1-ABC-# @(Off-camera) That 's right . And he has to be able to answer for them confidently . I mean , that seems to be the bigger issue here , which is , he puts it out there and then he backs up a little bit . And that goes to the heart of the problem , I think , we 're all getting at , whether it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not a core there and people ca n't hold onto it . Listen , I think that - that he can defend himself and his record and his wealth and his - his record on Wall Street , but he has to look confident doing it . And he has to look as if he can do that with Barack Obama , not just in a Republican debate . @!KATRINA-VANDEN-HEU# But last night , Mitt Romney abandoned the job-creation argument . It was really an argument for success and the ability to make wealth in this country . His job-creation numbers have been repudiated . His tax figures will now be raked over . He has offshore banking accounts via Bain . This is a moment not of populism in this country ... @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) He pays a full US tax on it . @!KATRINA-VANDEN-HEU# Were Bain - but he has - but he has now entered a moment which I think his team never anticipated . There was a smugness and arrogance about being the inevitable candidate that led them to sort of be unaware of the mood in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ view that the elites - there are elites in this country , that the government is rigged against you and that you need to find a way to open it up out of the special interest money . @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) Well , I want to ask George a question on this . How do you explain why Mitt Romney is having so much difficulty with this issue ? What is it that he 's trying to hide ? Where does the discomfort come from ? @!GEORGE-WILL-@1-ABC# @(Off-camera) You mean on the taxes ? @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) Yeah . @!GEORGE-WILL-@1-ABC# @(Off-camera) I do n't know . We 'll know when we get , perhaps , more than two years , because once you start from , " Maybe I 'll release one year , " then you say , " I 'm going to release two , " the call will now go up , " What 's in the third year ? " And if you release the third , what 's in the fourth ? So he 's going to have to have a large ... @!MATTHEW-DOWD-@1-AB# @(Off-camera) I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've been with enough candidates , George , and you 've been with enough candidates , and we 've all been with enough candidates - I do n't think it 's that he has something to hide . I do n't think that 's it at all . I do n't think there 's like , whoa , what 's - what 's all this ? What I think it is , is a typical candidate that decides they do n't think they need to do it . And in 1994 , he said I 'm not doing it , he never released them . In 2002 running for governor , he never released them . As governor , he never released them . He runs for president , never released them . He gets in his head , " I do n't need to release them , " and no matter what anybody tells him , that 's the problem . @!RON-BROWNSTEIN-@1E# Here 's where - I have to give an anonymous shout-out to one senior Romney supporter in South Carolina who said to me Friday , " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ South Carolina primary , " that basically , that once he lost , they were going to come out , and why not release them beforehand to give yourself a better chance to win ? @!RON-BROWNSTEIN-@1E# But , you know , I think the - where the taxes fall into a larger issue for Romney is the electability concern and his eroding performance on that measure , because he has looked so unsteady on his feet in the last two weeks . You know , we had this bizarre period through the fall and early winter , where the other candidates were really jostling to become the alternative to Romney and so were focusing their fire on each other , rather than him . Starting in that Sunday before , that debate the Sunday before New Hampshire , he has been in the crosshairs , and he has not done well . He had a very bad week in South Carolina . @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) And , George - I mean , it 's clear . And , George , they are banking on Florida being the backstop , big state , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have voted . He 's been working the absentees . It 's a closed primary . But Jeb Bush - I think the Romney campaign had been counting on Jeb Bush giving them an endorsement . He said last night he 's going to stay neutral . @!GEORGE-WILL-@1-ABC# @(Off-camera) Yeah . Well , remember , we 're going to go down the road and we 're going to find , I think , Newt 's not on the Virginia ballot . He may - is he on Missouri ? I ca n't ... @!AMY-WALTER-@1-ABC-# @(Off-camera) Nope . @!GEORGE-WILL-@1-ABC# @(Off-camera) He 's not on Missouri , so he 's not competitive everywhere . Here 's a small sliver of a silver lining for Mitt Romney . All across the country this morning , people are waking up who are running for office as Republicans , from dogcatcher to Senate , and they 're saying , " Good god , Newt Gingrich might be at the top of this ticket . " And that ca n't make them happy . @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) You know , I want to stop everybody there , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to come back , and we 're going to focus this question of where the Republican nomination goes next , also look ahead to the President 's State of the Union . @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) Could a third-party candidate , are the chances of that going up this time around . @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) And finally , that Internet blackout this week that had the late-night comics buzzing . @!CLIP: " JIMMY KIMMEL LIVE " @!JIMMY-KIMMEL-@1HOS# Wikipedia was one of 7,000 websites that went black today , along with Craigslist and Reddit , and even Lolcats , L-O-L cats .

COMMERCIAL BREAK ' 
##4103515 @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) Good morning , everyone . And overnight , it is a brand-new race for the Republican nomination . After finishing fourth in Iowa and fifth in New Hampshire , former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich surged to a strong win in South Carolina . @GRAPHICS @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Voiceover) Look at those numbers , 40% of the vote to Mitt Romney 's 28% , with Rick Santorum third at 17%. @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) And in his victory speech last night , Gingrich struck a populist chord . @!NEWT-GINGRICH-@1RE# The American people feel that they have elites who have been trying for a half-century to force us to quit being American and become some kind of other system . @!NEWT-GINGRICH-@1RE# And the reaction - people completely misunderstand what 's going on . It 's not that I am a good debater . It is that I articulate the deepest felt values of the American people . @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) After congratulating Gingrich , Mitt Romney attacked . @!MITT-ROMNEY-@1REPU# In recent weeks , the choice within our party has also come into stark focus . President Obama has no experience running @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ party ca n't be led to victory by someone who also has never run a business and never run a state . @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) Yesterday 's vote was n't the only loss for Romney this week . On Friday , the Iowa Republican Party took away his eight-vote squeaker in that state 's caucuses , announcing after a recount that Rick Santorum was the winner . @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) And we begin this morning with that candidate , Rick Santorum . He 's down in South Carolina this morning . Thanks for coming out this morning , Senator . Third-place win - third place in South Carolina , not a win at all . And you 're going to be facing right now enormous pressure from many conservatives to get out of this race so they can rally behind one alternative to Mitt Romney , Newt Gingrich . Any chance you 're going to buckle to that ? @!RICK-SANTORUM-@1RE# No , in fact , a lot of conservatives are very concerned about the choice between Mitt Romney and Newt Gingrich , because in their opinion and in mine , that 's not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a choice between a moderate and an erratic conservative , someone who on a lot of the major issues has been just wrong . @!RICK-SANTORUM-@1RE# The - for example , the government-mandated health insurance that is at the core of Obamacare is something Newt Gingrich has supported for 20 years . The big bank Wall Street bailout , something that Newt Gingrich supported . Sitting on the couch with Nancy Pelosi during a very critical time when we were trying to fight off the cap-and-trade bill , immigration and a path to citizenship . I mean , these are core issues of the Republican base where Newt Gingrich is absolutely wrong and , by the way , Mitt Romney is wrong . @!RICK-SANTORUM-@1RE# And , really , the race is a three-person race , and there 's one strong , consistent conservative in this race . There 's one candidate that can rally the Republican base , one candidate you do n't have to worry about what he 's going to say or do . He 's going to , you know , criticize Paul Ryan 's plan as right-wing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to leave him , you know , en masse . This is not , you know , the old Newt . This is the last six months . So there 's a big , big difference between these three candidates . @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) But , Senator , you 've been making that case for some time right now . @GRAPHICS @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Voiceover) But looking at the exit polls coming out of South Carolina , among the voters who thought that electability , who can beat Obama , was more important - there were a lot of them , 45% - Newt Gingrich got 51% of them , Romney 37% . You were way down at 7%. @GRAPHICS @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Voiceover) And then of candidates looking for a very conservative candidate , a lot of those , as well , 36% , but Newt Gingrich gets almost - more than double what you got . @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) So if you 're not winning among the very conservative and you 're not winning among those who want to beat Obama , what 's your rationale ? @!RICK-SANTORUM-@1RE# Well , look , we - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were just the opposite . You look at the numbers in New Hampshire , they were - they were tilted in a different direction . I mean , Newt put his flag here in South Carolina . It 's a state that he knows well . It 's a neighboring state for him . He spent all of his time and money down here . I spent a lot - most of my time and money - and certainly time , not money - in Iowa . And this is - you know , these three races , in many respects , were - are baked much more than the races going forward . @!RICK-SANTORUM-@1RE# And now we 're going to have an opportunity for folks who have n't had the kind of exposure to the candidates that the three early primary states have , and we 're going to see a very , very different dynamic . George , there 's one thing you know , that if you do n't like the state of the play of the race right now , just wait until the next race . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And that 's the dynamism of this race . @!RICK-SANTORUM-@1RE# So this idea that , because one person did well , Newt finished fourth and fifth . Where was everybody calling him to get out of the race ? You know , we finished a very - you know , we came from single digits in the last week and - and really had a strong finish , a good debate . You know , we won Iowa , got really no bump from that because it happened the day before the primary . There 's a lot - there 's a lot of races to go . We 're going to Florida and beyond . @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) I think this year you 're right , expect the unexpected , every single week . I take your point on that . Senator , you started to make the case against former Speaker Gingrich in your first answer there , talking about him being erratic . At the debate on Thursday night , you said he was grandiose . Let 's take a look . @!RICK-SANTORUM-@1RE# I do n't want a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking at the paper the next day and figuring out , what is he - worrying about what he 's going to say next . @!RICK-SANTORUM-@1RE# That , you know , worrisome moment that something that 's going to pop , and we ca n't afford that in a nominee . @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) Are you saying that Newt Gingrich is too unstable to be the Republican nominee ? @!RICK-SANTORUM-@1RE# I think if you look at - look , Newt 's a good friend of mine , and I 'm - period . He 's a good friend of mine , and I like Newt , and he 's , he 's a brilliant guy who has tons of ideas . The issue is discipline . The issue is leadership . If you look at his leadership , when he was in the House of Representatives , there was a conservative coup within three years of him becoming the speaker and eventually was forced out because of , well , you know , issues of being able to focus , execute , discipline , order , not taking - you know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left field . You see this repeatedly . @!RICK-SANTORUM-@1RE# This is not the kind of leadership we need to take on Barack Obama . We have to have a stark contrast . We have to have someone who makes Obama the issue in this race , not the Republican nominee . If , if the Republican nominee is someone that the Obama - can - can drop $1 billion on ads on top of and make him the issue , then we 're going to be in tough shape to be able to win this election . @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) So you like Newt , but you do n't think he can be trusted with the nomination or trusted with the White House ? @!RICK-SANTORUM-@1RE# Yeah , I think he 's - he 's a high - a very high-risk candidate . That 's - I mean , I 've said that from the very beginning . Again , a lot of ideas , brilliant in that respect , but as far as focus , as far as being able to rely on him to come out and - and deliver that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ folks in the House and Senate , not undermine some of the basic things - look , sitting on a couch with Nancy Pelosi is not a particularly - not a particularly solid conservative thing when you 're out there , as I was , fighting this - this junk science of manmade global warming and cap-and-trade , and Newt was on the other side . This is - this is the kind of behavior that we can not have out of a nominee . @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) What about Mitt Romney ? He may not have the momentum right now , but he does have the money , and his Super PAC is already spending it in the big state of Florida , taking aim at you . Take a look . @!NARRATOR-@1POLITIC# Barack Obama knows four facts about Rick Santorum that you do n't . Santorum pushed for billions in wasteful pork , voting for the Bridge to Nowhere , a teapot museum , even an indoor rain forest . Santorum voted to raise the debt limit five times , increasing spending and debt by $3 trillion . And he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And I know your campaign says you like to live off the land , but how are you going to compete with those kind of resources in the huge state of Florida ? @!RICK-SANTORUM-@1RE# Well , I mean , we 're going to - we 're going to run everywhere . This race is n't going to be over next week in Florida . It 's not going to be over the week after when we go to Colorado and Minnesota and Missouri . Look , this is going to be a long race . There 's going to be a lot of opportunities for the rest of the country - I hear this all the time - why should three states decide who our nominee is ? Well , in this race , it 's not going to happen . In this race , we 're going to have a long campaign , Florida will have its say , you know , Nevada will have its say , and we keep going from state to state . And I feel very , very comfortable that as people continue to focus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person to win - you know , that campaign ad , first off , the felon part - Mitt Romney even admitted that that was wrong . @!RICK-SANTORUM-@1RE# The second part , the spending - there 's been nobody better that - in cutting entitlements and reforming spending - those projects he mentioned , none of them were ever built . The reason that - that we go through this process is to propose things that - here in the federal level . And the states have a say as to whether they 're built or not , and then none of them were . @!RICK-SANTORUM-@1RE# So this is - you know , this is the best he has . Why do n't we talk about my record on Social Security and Medicare and Medicaid , what I 've done on welfare reform and transforming the system ? We 've got the strongest record on spending , and I 'm anxious to match that up against Mitt Romney and Newt Gingrich. @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) But Senator - where do you plant your flag ? You mentioned Nevada . Mitt Romney is pretty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to go play in all of those big caucus states . Your own home state of Pennsylvania does n't even come up until late April . Where do you get your next win ? @!RICK-SANTORUM-@1RE# You know , I - to be honest with you , people asked me that before . Where do you get your first win ? And we were able to pull off a big upset . Our feeling is that , you know , we go out and compete . This is a long haul . We picked up delegates today - excuse me , yesterday . We 're going to pick up delegates in the coming weeks . And we 're going to have an opportunity , as states in this race evolves , we 're going to have opportunities to win states . That 's what we believe . We believe that our message is the best and that conservatives have and are starting and will increasingly start rallying around us when they look at the choices . @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) How big a blow was yesterday to Mitt Romney ? @!RICK-SANTORUM-@1RE# Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he was 2-0 , about to become 3-0 , and this nomination in his and the minds of the media , anyway , was over . He 's now - I 've beaten Mitt Romney . Newt Gingrich has beaten Mitt Romney . The idea that conservatives have to coalesce in order to beat Mitt Romney , well , that 's just not true anymore . Conservatives actually can have a choice . We ca n't - we do n't have to rush to judgment . We can actually look at the candidates . @!RICK-SANTORUM-@1RE# The longer this campaign goes on , George , the better it is for conservatives , the better it is for our party . We stay focused on the issues , which is going out and taking on Barack Obama . The Republicans are the focus . I know why the media would love to have this race over , because they 'd like to - and the Obama administration , because they 'd like to take aim on whoever the nominee as quickly as they can and start carpet-bombing them . I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't think it 's a good thing that it does happen . @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) Well , it looks like it 's going to be a long one . Senator Santorum , thanks for your time this morning . @!RICK-SANTORUM-@1RE# Thank you very much , George . Appreciate it . '

ABC 's Andrea Canning is here with the latest on all this . @!ROBIN-ROBERTS-@1-A# @(Off-camera) Good morning . @!ANDREA-CANNING-@1-# @(Off-camera) Good morning , Robin . And the closing arguments in this case , they were explosive . @!ROBIN-ROBERTS-@1-A# @(Off-camera) Oh , yeah . @!ANDREA-CANNING-@1-# @(Off-camera) Prosecution said Nanette Johnston 's power to manipulate men was her talent on earth , her gift . They painted a picture of a promiscuous , greedy and heartless liar who lured in the victim with a classified ad that read , " wealthy men only . " The defense , however , says there 's no physical evidence to tie her to the murder . @!MICK-HILL-@1DEPUTY# The single , strongest piece of evidence ... @!ANDREA-CANNING-@1-# @(Voiceover) It was a war of words between the defense ... @!MICK-HILL-@1DEPUTY# The center point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my client was involved in a conspiracy with Mr. Naposki , is horse manure . @!ANDREA-CANNING-@1-# @(Voiceover) ... and the prosecution . @!MATT-MURPHY-@1SENI# You just heard two hours of crap in an Irish accent . @!ANDREA-CANNING-@1-# @(Voiceover) Both sides presented their closing arguments Thursday in the Nannette Johnston murder trial . The former model is accused of having her wealthy fiancT , Bill McLaughlin , killed in cold blood nearly two decades ago . On December 15th , 1994 , McLaughlin , a 55-year-old inventor , was shot six times inside his home . At the time , he was living with Johnson , then a beautiful 25-year-old who lured in the lonely bachelor. @!MATT-MURPHY-@1SENI# She knows that she 's a con artist , a rip-off queen ... @!ANDREA-CANNING-@1-# @(Voiceover) No arrests were made at the time , but 15 years later , prosecutors re-examined the evidence . They charged Johnston , and her lover , Eric Naposki , a former NFL linebacker , with murder , alleging she put him up to the crime so they could make millions off McLaughlin 's death . @!MATT-MURPHY-@1SENI# Death equals money . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @!ANDREA-CANNING-@1-# @(Voiceover) The defense said Johnston has a solid alibi and said that Naposki , who was convicted of McLaughlin 's murder last year , acted alone out of jealousy . They acknowledge the affair , but argued she was a smart MBA grad who would never leave her wealthy fiancT. @!MICK-HILL-@1DEPUTY# Hate her as much as you want for being a thief , a liar , a cheat , but you ca n't vote guilty based on that . @!ANDREA-CANNING-@1-# @(Voiceover) The prosecution said Johnston planned the whole thing and gave Naposki a key to access the home . She had already stolen a half million dollars from McLaughlin before the murder even happened . @!MATT-MURPHY-@1SENI# She was going to get caught for the thefts , and she was going to get caught for that affair . The only question is when . That 's why Bill had to die . @!ANDREA-CANNING-@1-# @(Off-camera) As we mentioned , Eric Naposki has already been convicted of murdering Bill McLaughlin . He will be sentenced today . As for Nanette Johnston , the jury will - continue deliberating on her case on Monday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ verdict next week . @!ROBIN-ROBERTS-@1-A# @(Off-camera) Okay . Andrea , thank you . We 're gon na bring in our " GMA " legal Dan Abrams here in the studio with us . And in Atlanta , Nancy Grace , the host of " Nancy Grace " on HLN . And , Nancy , did the prosecution do its job enough to convict here , do you think ? @!NANCY-GRACE-@1HOST# They absolutely did , and the defense actually helped them along with Johnston 's own words . Back when it all went down , of course , she did not take the stand . That was not a surprise . But she gave an audio recording , which came back to haunt her at trial . It was played in front of the jury . But then the defense tried to come up with a big " Dial M for Murder " moment , straight out of Alfred Hitchcock , claiming that there had been a switcheroo with the keys . But as it turned out , their whole premise fell flat in closing arguments , and I think they lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you had said from the beginning that it was gon na be very hard to get a conviction here though . @!DAN-ABRAMS-@1-ABC-# @(Off-camera) Well , I , I thought it was gon na be harder than his trial ... @!ROBIN-ROBERTS-@1-A# @(Off-camera) Yeah . Mm-hmm . @!DAN-ABRAMS-@1-ABC-# @(Off-camera) ... right , because in , in his trial , remember , he 's the one accused of actually doing the shooting , so you had evidence with regard to him of a gun . @!DAN-ABRAMS-@1-ABC-# @(Voiceover) You had evidence with regard to him where someone who made the key - remember ... @!ROBIN-ROBERTS-@1-A# @(Voiceover) Right . @!DAN-ABRAMS-@1-ABC-# @(Voiceover) ... the key , the key is absolutely crucial in this case , because there was a brand-new , just-made key left at the crime scene in the lock . So whoever did this had recently gotten a copy ... @!NANCY-GRACE-@1HOST# In the door , he 's right . In the door . @!DAN-ABRAMS-@1-ABC-# @(Voiceover) Right , in the door . They , they - they - recently made a copy of the key . And there was someone who testified in his trial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having keys made . @!DAN-ABRAMS-@1-ABC-# @(Off-camera) So his trial was an easier one , in my view , than hers . With that said , I think there 's a lot of evidence against her . There 's a lot of motive evidence , in particular . @!ROBIN-ROBERTS-@1-A# @(Off-camera) And , Nancy , you alluded to this just a moment ago . Her own attorneys are saying , look , she 's a thief , she 's a liar , she 's not a good person . How does that play , but , you know , but - given all that she still did not do , she did n't murder her , him , was n't a part of it . How does all that play ... @!NANCY-GRACE-@1HOST# Well , actually ... @!ROBIN-ROBERTS-@1-A# @(Off-camera) ... when your attorney is saying those kind of things about you ? @!NANCY-GRACE-@1HOST# Well , you know , it does n't play because , what , that 's tired . It 's old . She 's a thief , she 's a liar , she 's a - a cheat , but she 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defense . And when you look at , when , if you do n't get away from the circumstantial evidence , now , Dan will argue , like many defense attorneys , that is just circumstantial evidence . But the judge tells the jury , circumstantial evidence is as valuable as direct evidence ... @!DAN-ABRAMS-@1-ABC-# @(Off-camera) Yeah . @!NANCY-GRACE-@1HOST# ... such as an eyewitness . And here , we see her writing a big , fat check , forging it for $250,000 the day before he 's murdered , and it actually clears ... @!DAN-ABRAMS-@1-ABC-# @(Off-camera) Nancy ... @!NANCY-GRACE-@1HOST# ... while he 's cold there on the kitchen floor , 250 grand . @!DAN-ABRAMS-@1-ABC-# @(Off-camera) Nancy is - Nancy is confusing a bad case with a bad defense , meaning they , they do n't have a great case here , the defense . @!NANCY-GRACE-@1HOST# No , they go hand in hand . @!DAN-ABRAMS-@1-ABC-# @(Off-camera) And , no they don't. @!NANCY-GRACE-@1HOST# They go hand in hand , Dan . @!DAN-ABRAMS-@1-ABC-# @(Off-camera) The bottom line is are you saying - it was n't a mistake . @!NANCY-GRACE-@1HOST# They both stink . Whoa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's question to you was do you think it was a mistake for them to make all these concessions ? To say she 's a thief , she 's a bad person . They had to . They had no choice but to do that . Now , that 's a bad case . @!NANCY-GRACE-@1HOST# They do n't have to do anything . @!DAN-ABRAMS-@1-ABC-# @(Off-camera) That 's not a bad defense . @!NANCY-GRACE-@1HOST# They could take a guilty plea and tell the truth . They both are bad . @!DAN-ABRAMS-@1-ABC-# @(Off-camera) Well ... @!NANCY-GRACE-@1HOST# And the defense attorney ... @!DAN-ABRAMS-@1-ABC-# @(Off-camera) Right . @!NANCY-GRACE-@1HOST# ... got twisted up in his own - argument in front of the jury and was embarrassed by the prosecution . So long story short , she writes a bad check , she stands to get a - $1 million life insurance policy . And then , after he 's shot , she calls her husband , her first husband , of many , to the stand , the state calls him and goes , oh , yeah , it was really weird . She - took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he got a trophy at the end of the game but she left . What mom in her right mind leaves her little boy 's soccer game when he 's getting a trophy at the end to go do a murder ? She could n't stay 30 minutes extra to see the trophy ? No , she had to go kill her boyfriend , people . @!DAN-ABRAMS-@1-ABC-# @(Off-camera) One of the things I 'll , I 'll agree with Nancy on is the fact that part of the defense here is she would have n't been so dumb as to blank , right ? @!ROBIN-ROBERTS-@1-A# @(Off-camera) Right . @!DAN-ABRAMS-@1-ABC-# @(Off-camera) She 's an - she has a master 's degree , she has all this education , she would n't have been so dumb . There are people ... @!NANCY-GRACE-@1HOST# She never went to college , Dan . @!DAN-ABRAMS-@1-ABC-# @(Off-camera) There are people who do ... @!NANCY-GRACE-@1HOST# It came out on the stand . @!DAN-ABRAMS-@1-ABC-# @(Off-camera) There are people who do ... @!NANCY-GRACE-@1HOST# She does n't have a master's. @!DAN-ABRAMS-@1-ABC-# @(Off-camera) ... dumb , dumb things all the time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you keep saying she 's got a master 's degree ? @!DAN-ABRAMS-@1-ABC-# @(Off-camera) No , I was saying that her lawyer was saying that she all this experience ... @!NANCY-GRACE-@1HOST# She did n't even graduated high school . @!DAN-ABRAMS-@1-ABC-# @(Off-camera) ... et cetera , and so , and , and - the point is that the , the **39;93;TOOLONG almost never works because so often criminal defendants do do things that are that dumb . @!ROBIN-ROBERTS-@1-A# @(Off-camera) We 'll see what happens . @!NANCY-GRACE-@1HOST# Guys , she even faked out " GMA . " This woman does not have an MBA . @!DAN-ABRAMS-@1-ABC-# @(Off-camera) Okay . Okay . @!NANCY-GRACE-@1HOST# In fact , her husband says he does n't even think she went to high school . She lied about everything . @!ROBIN-ROBERTS-@1-A# @(Off-camera) Final ? @!DAN-ABRAMS-@1-ABC-# @(Off-camera) You know , I guess that 's ... @!ROBIN-ROBERTS-@1-A# @(Off-camera) Wow . Left you speechless . @!DAN-ABRAMS-@1-ABC-# @(Off-camera) Yeah , yeah . @!NANCY-GRACE-@1HOST# What ? @!ROBIN-ROBERTS-@1-A# @(Off-camera) All right .

And it 's a very special generation , and Daddy was very quite and very proud . He did n't tell a lot of stories , we had to get it out of him . But , so accurate to what I have seen on film with " Red Tails . " And the beauty of it is just like the other actors have said , this , it 's a film about heroes , not victims . The stories my Daddy said match up very well to what we 're seeing on the film . @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Voiceover) And how incredible to see the coach of the Alabama football team to pull that out for inspiration . @!JOSH-ELLIOTT-@1-AB# @(Off-camera) You know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . @!ROBIN-ROBERTS-@1-A# @(Off-camera) It is. @!JOSH-ELLIOTT-@1-AB# @(Off-camera) You know , it 's - it really does transcend .

##4103520 @!MITT-ROMNEY-@1REPU# President Obama wants to put free enterprise on trial . @!PRESIDENT-BARACK-O# The free market has never been a free license to take whatever you can from whoever you can . @!MITT-ROMNEY-@1REPU# This president is making the federal government bigger , burdensome , and bloated . I will make the federal government simpler , smaller , and smarter . @!PRESIDENT-BARACK-O# We should n't weakening oversight and accountability , we should be strengthening oversight and accountability . @!MITT-ROMNEY-@1REPU# This president has enacted job-killing regulations . I 'll eliminate them . @!PRESIDENT-BARACK-O# We 've always come together through our government to help create the conditions where both workers and businesses can succeed . @!MITT-ROMNEY-@1REPU# This president puts his faith in government . We put our faith in the American people . @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) A little preview of what could be the fall campaign , now to talk about it on our roundtable . We got a great roundtable together today . Joining us from the Newseum in Washington , George Will and Cokie Roberts . Here with us in the studio , Paul Krugman from " The New York Times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wall Street Journal " , ABC 's Jon Karl . @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) And , George , let me begin with you . We want to get into that big debate on free enterprise and fairness coming up . But first , Mitt Romney in South Carolina , polls show a pretty close race , even though social conservatives are now rallying behind Rick Santorum . It seems like Romney is being helped by a split opposition . @!GEORGE-WILL-@1-ABC# @(Off-camera) He has . George , the Republicans have n't had a really protracted nominating contest since 1976 , when the Reagan-Gerald Ford fight went all the way to the Kansas City convention . We 've had the two first nominating events in Iowa and New Hampshire , which are swing states . South Carolina is solidly Republican . Rick Perry is a veteran on this , campaigning in a state with 450,000 veterans . Newt Gingrich is from next door in Georgia . Rick Santorum is an evangelical Christian , campaigning now in a state with that 60% of the Republican vote . And still , and still , it looks as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may even win , win or come in a close second . They go on right away to South - to Florida , a very expensive state to campaign in . So it 's very possible that this whole contest could be over on the 31st day of this month when Florida votes . @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) That would - that would be incredible . And , Jon Karl , you were covering this group of social conservatives who met yesterday , trying to prevent that from happening . They have come behind now , Rick Santorum saying he should be the candidate to take on Mitt Romney. @!JONATHAN-KARL-@1-A# @(Off-camera) Yes , but a couple points about that . First of all , it took them three ballots to get there . So it was n't like Santorum was the overwhelming , immediate favorite here . And , you know , there 's no sign in South Carolina that social conservatives have rallied behind Rick Santorum. @GRAPHICS @!JONATHAN-KARL-@1-A# @(Off-camera) It remains a divided field among them , again , working very well for Mitt Romney . And on George 's point about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Florida . Now , what is the one campaign that has an absentee ballot program going on in Florida , it 's the Mitt Romney campaign . @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) So he could already be putting it away in Florida ? Peggy , you spent some time this week in South Carolina . @!PEGGY-NOONAN-@1WAL# I did . @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) It seems like you came away with the impression that Romney was going to get it . The question is how much damage he 's going to take . @!PEGGY-NOONAN-@1WAL# Yes , how much damage under these Bain attacks , how much money is spent by the Super PACs and by campaigns to do the Bain attacks . What struck me as so interesting about South Carolina , is indeed it is true , the not-Mitts have not had a chance to come forward because they 're broken up . The evangelical vote itself is broken up . The Tea Party vote is broken up . So , the solid vote is the Romney vote . So , he looks like - he 's in a very good position . The interesting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bark - and that is the assumption on many parts , that the evangelical vote in South Carolina would naturally perforce reject the Mormon candidate , has n't happened . @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) That 's exactly what I wrote in my notes . @!COKIE-ROBERTS-@1-A# @(Off-camera) But that 's part of it George , though , you know ... @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) And I just want to bring it to you , Cokie ? Surprising ? @!COKIE-ROBERTS-@1-A# @(Off-camera) Right . It is surprising . But keep in mind , Rick Santorum is a Catholic . And they 're not particularly popular in South Carolina , either . So , I think that , you know , you 've not - you do n't have the obvious person to go to . Newt Gingrich has all of his moral problems . You 've got the Mormon , the Catholic and Rick Perry . And his campaign seems dead . So it really is , it 's just too - it 's too hard for everybody to come down on the side of one of these conservatives . @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) Meanwhile , Paul Krugman , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mentioned this . Really interesting to see the social conservatives now coming behind Rick Santorum , but you saw the establishment close ranks behind Mitt Romney even more in reaction to these Bain attacks . @!PAUL-KRUGMAN-@1NEW# Well , it 's - yes , because , look , the rule for the Republican Party these past 30 years has been you use your social conservative issues to rally the base and to win elections . But , ultimately , it 's always in the hands of the economic conservatives . Ultimately , it 's always - you know , whatever they talk about , in fact , the priority after the election is about cutting taxes on rich people . You know , 2004 , George Bush won reelection by promising to defend the country against gay married terrorists , and then the day after the election , he says now I have a mandate to privatize Social Security . So Mitt Romney is the kind of the guy that the Republican Party has - the Republican establishment has always wanted . @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) He is the next in line , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on these other issues . @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) Go ahead , Cokie. @!COKIE-ROBERTS-@1-A# @(Off-camera) Rick Perry was making a good point , though , that - I mean , . It 's obviously in his self-interest to make this point . But to get these attacks out of the way now really does help the Republican Party . Clearly , it would be a huge upset if Romney were not the nominee at this point . @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) You know ... @!COKIE-ROBERTS-@1-A# @(Off-camera) And these - and these - and this whole line of attack is certainly one that the President would use against him . And it seem to me that ... @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) There 's no question about that , Cokie , but that 's why everybody is shaking their heads - well , almost everybody . Peggy and Paul both want in . But it does raise an important question . And I want to bring in George Will first and then get Peggy and Paul here . Do these attacks immunize Romney or infect him ? @GRAPHICS @!GEORGE-WILL-@1-ABC# @(Off-camera) I think they do both . But they probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been 70 years , George , since Joseph Schumpeter , a famous Austrian economist then at Harvard , put into our vocabulary the phrase " creative destruction . " American people are clear that capitalism destroys jobs on occasion . Over one 25-year period recently , it was estimated that 15% of all American jobs disappear every year to try to create more than that . So it 's the adjective . Is it creative destruction ? And in this sense , it seems to me , it 's much better to have this argument now than in October . And in the South Carolina , it 's extremely good for Mitt Romney to be attacked now in the vocabulary of the left . @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) Paul ? @!PAUL-KRUGMAN-@1NEW# Yeah , the thing is it would only immunize him if the thing would go away . This is not like some punitive scandal that , once everybody 's heard the story , it stops being a story . The issue about jobs , about economic inequality is going to - is going to continue to resonate . So I think it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gives the Democrats a chance to quote Republicans , saying the same thing they 're doing . @!PAUL-KRUGMAN-@1NEW# @(Off-camera) Plus , you know , we are learning more about Mitt Romney . This morning 's " Washington Post " had a very interesting article about how Bain functioned under Romney , which said basically they were into double-crossing . Not double-crossing the poor workers , but double-crossing their partners in deals . @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) So , the stories on Bain keep coming . @!PAUL-KRUGMAN-@1NEW# So , yeah . @!PEGGY-NOONAN-@1WAL# I think there is no inoculating Romney against the Bain attacks . The potential is that they can become exhausted by September , October and November . There 's no inoculating . There may be exhausting . But let me tell you what I think the threat of the Bain attacks is . Romney has been coming forward , identifying himself as a businessman , a job creator , a man who knows how to turn around an economy , and that 's a good place to be and Republicans love that person . However , there 's a strong populous streak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they do n't like these Wall Street sharpies who , in the 1990s and in the ' 00s , were rapacious , greedy and bad guys . @!COKIE-ROBERTS-@1-A# @(Off-camera) And we ... @!PEGGY-NOONAN-@1WAL# There 's a difference between I 'm a businessman and oh , my gosh , I was secretly a bad guy . That 's the potential harm . @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) Jon and then Cokie. @!COKIE-ROBERTS-@1-A# @(Off-camera) Also , we do n't elect businessmen . @!JONATHAN-KARL-@1-A# @(Off-camera) Undoubtedly , but , you know , these attacks have been clumsy . And I am mystified as to why Romney opponents have n't done more to go after his record as governor of Massachusetts . You know ... @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) Well , they 're starting that now . You 're seeing that in the final week . @!JONATHAN-KARL-@1-A# @(Off-camera) Yeah , but I mean we 're almost over here . You know , the rate of job growth in Massachusetts is six times higher for government jobs than private sector jobs . That 's the kind of thing that would resonate . But this documentary that the Super PAC for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's unbelievably bad . I mean , it 's wrong on the facts . Three of the people featured ... @!PAUL-KRUGMAN-@1NEW# Since when has that been a problem ? @!JONATHAN-KARL-@1-A# @(Off-camera) Yeah , but three of the people in this were - you know , actually got raises under Bain when , you know , when Romney was there . They did n't lose their jobs until Bain sold it to a teachers union in Canada . I mean , it 's been ... @!PEGGY-NOONAN-@1WAL# If that becomes the answer that will be a powerful answer , but when you just look at that half-hour , not really knowing that much , it 's got power . @!JONATHAN-KARL-@1-A# @(Off-camera) It 's got power and they were slow to respond . I mean the Romney people were slow to point out that the thing was riddled with inaccuracies . @!PEGGY-NOONAN-@1WAL# Absolutely . @!COKIE-ROBERTS-@1-A# @(Off-camera) One thing that happens , though , is that people always talk about these business men like they are some big saviors . And they run for governor all the time . They 've run for Senate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and large , we do n't elect them . By the time the Election Day comes along , enough has been said about their businesses that disturb people , but even more so , their sort of lack of political ability disturbs people . And so , you know , you have to be careful about running as a businessman ... @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) And that does to a big ... @!COKIE-ROBERTS-@1-A# @(Off-camera) ... because generally , we do n't vote for them . @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) That does lead to a big development . I want to show the cover of this week 's " Economist . " @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Voiceover) It 's got Mitt Romney up there , under the headline " America 's Next CEO . " Paul , you weighed in on this week in " The New York Times " , saying America is not a corporation . @!PAUL-KRUGMAN-@1NEW# Yes , it 's , you know , even if we had Steve Jobs running instead of - instead of Mitt Romney , you know , or Gordon Gekko , whoever we 're getting here , those are not the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same - it 's not even intellectually the same thing . The things that you have to do to run an economy are very , very different from things you have to do to run a corporation . @!PAUL-KRUGMAN-@1NEW# And , you know , the thing about Romney is his opponents do n't have to make a case that he was evil . They just have to cast doubt on his case , which is that I know how to run this thing because I ran a successful business . And , of course , you know , we have a situation which is macroeconomic problems . And macroeconomic problems are almost exactly the kind of thing where thinking like a corporate leader , is all wrong . @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) And , George Will , did Mitt Romney make a mistake in - and maybe a mistake akin to what the Obama administration did when they promised 8 million jobs - 8% unemployment coming out of the stimulus by saying that he created more than 100,000 jobs at Bain Capital ? @!GEORGE-WILL-@1-ABC# @(Off-camera) Well , it invites a lot of bookkeeping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and how many destroyed . The fact is , capitalism , in some of its aspects , is a lot like surgery , it 's necessary . But you do n't want to look at it up close because it 's unpleasant . And I think the American people understand this . You know , George , the part of our society that has seen the most creative destruction is the intensive industry of agriculture . A hundred years ago , 30% of the American people were working in agriculture . Today it 's less than 2% . I do n't think the Americans are upset by that . @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) But how about on the point that Peggy was making , George , do you think , you know , in order to put this election away , Republicans are going to have to really corral at lot of its blue-collar base who are n't in love with Wall Street ? @!JONATHAN-KARL-@1-A# @(Off-camera) They 're not in love with Wall Street . They 're not in love with the professorial president . And it 's going to be very hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's why the Republicans , so far - one of the lessons of their campaign is that the enthusiasm and energy they were counting on to drive their campaign throughout 2012 , the enthusiasm is not yet there . @!COKIE-ROBERTS-@1-A# @(Off-camera) Except that Obama is likely to give it to them . I mean , that is the case . They 're expecting Barack Obama to inject the enthusiasm into the Republican base . @!PEGGY-NOONAN-@1WAL# One of the great phrases that has been used in defense of venture capitalism and Bain Capital is Schumpeter 's " creative destruction . " Whenever I hear Republicans say that , I want to say , you know what America has been looking for five years at a lot of destruction , creative and non-creative . They 're not going to like that defense . They 're going to like a defense that says , guess what , I can create jobs , I have a plan , we can move this thing forward , we can save our country . Treatises on the essential nature of capitalism , I think , wo n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we just talk substance about the - instead of the campaign for a moment , the fact of the matter is that creative destruction is a great thing when the economy is near full employment and when the issue is clearing away the deadwood and getting new companies , we can make that case . But that 's not the world we 're living in right now . We 're living in a world that is kind of in a low-key version of the Great Depression , an economy with 13 million people out of work , with 4 million people out of work for more than a year . What you really need , substantively , is you need something that is about creating demand , about expanding employment . We do n't want ruthlessness . We do n't want - you know , and particularly , we do n't want to be slashing government spending while the economy is still deeply depressed . So if we actually do end up with a President Romney and if he actually does the things that he says he 's going to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @(Off-camera) Well , that is precisely the debate you saw right at the top of this " Roundtable " between the speech that Mitt Romney gave on Tuesday night in New Hampshire , and the one that President Obama gave in Kansas . President Obama saying you 're going to need government to help invest in certain parts of the economy . Mitt Romney 's basic point , get government out of the way . And ? @!COKIE-ROBERTS-@1-A# @(Off-camera) Well , that 's going to be the debate of this campaign . That is your bottom line debate that we are having right here in Washington right now in the Capitol , and the debate that 's going to be out there among the American people is the fundamental question on the role of government . And the Democrats continue to believe that it has more of a role than the Republicans do , particularly in this incarnation . You know , we 've seen times when Republicans think that the government should have more of a role but not right now . And Democrats are also wary about it because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voters about the deficit and the debt . And so , you know , it 's going to be a nuanced debate . But still that is the fundamental debate of this ... @!PAUL-KRUGMAN-@1NEW# There was an amazing Gallup result about people 's concerns . Are they concerned about employment or about the deficit ? And it 's totally class-linked . High income people worry about deficit . Low income people worry about employment . @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) Completely . That is - and , Jon , that means right now both parties have about a third of the electorate locked up , maybe a little bit more on that precise argument . But they 're going to be fighting over a sliver in the middle . @!JONATHAN-KARL-@1-A# @(Off-camera) Yes , and , you know , one of Romney 's problems during the primaries has been lower income . He has done very well among higher-income Republican voters . But even lower income , the populist Republicans , and this is what Gingrich has been talking . It 's not about using the language of the left . It 's about using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ connected with lower income middle class , working class Republicans . @!PAUL-KRUGMAN-@1NEW# His inability to even pretend to relate to the problems of ordinary people is quite extraordinary . You would think he would be a better actor than this . @!JONATHAN-KARL-@1-A# @(Off-camera) When he starts talking about fearing a pink slip , or how he likes to fire people , taken out of context or not , using that phrase , I promise you it will be taken out of context in the fall campaign . @!PAUL-KRUGMAN-@1NEW# Because it 's a phrase you would n't use if you had any feeling for people . @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) No question about that . Peggy ? @!PEGGY-NOONAN-@1WAL# There are some counties in South Carolina that have unemployment higher than 20% . Of course , joblessness is a big issue . I do n't imagine the 2012 campaign as being a lovely debate between Republicans and Democrats over the size of government . It should be big . It should be small . The fact is the American people kind of think that government often gets in the way of growth and gets in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like that . And if it 's like that , the Republicans will have a big leg up . But mostly people just want to see who can turn this thing around - this economic thing around . @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) I want to - I want to switch topics now . We 're also seeing this week a lot of fallout from this book about the Obamas by Jodi Kantor at " The New York Times . " It finally provoked a response from the First Lady herself with Gayle King . @!FIRST-LADY-MICHELL# I guess it 's more interesting to imagine this conflicted situation here and a strong woman , you know , but that 's been an image that people have tried to paint of me since , you know , the day Barack announced , that I 'm some angry black woman . @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) Cokie , the First Lady said that she had n't read the book , but clearly is irritated by what she has read about it in the last couple of days . It does show her butting heads at times with the White House @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But is the White House overreacting to the book ? @!COKIE-ROBERTS-@1-A# @(Off-camera) Probably . From what I understand , it 's a sympathetic portrayal of the First Lady . But , look , as you well know , staffs and first ladies do butt heads . And they have from the beginning . And staffs and candidates wives butt heads because the candidate 's wife or the First Lady has only one interest , and that is her husband 's back . And she is trying to do what she can to protect that . And staffs have other agendas. @!COKIE-ROBERTS-@1-A# @(Off-camera) It 's also true - this has been true from first ladies from the beginning . Martha Washington had troubles , you know , with the Congress because she wanted to get revolutionary soldiers their pensions , because she had to been to camp with them throughout those long eight years of the revolution . She also - by the way one of the other things that Mrs Obama is quoted as saying is that she hates living in the White House . Obviously she has tried to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be , fine , so do n't live there anymore , go away . @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) George , why do n't you weigh in on this ? @!COKIE-ROBERTS-@1-A# @(Off-camera) But , you know , again , let me just say quickly , Martha Washington also said , I am - " they call me First Lady of the land , " she wrote in a letter to a niece , " but I am more the chief state prisoner . " Because she was there , stuck in the house in New York . @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) Hear that all the time . Yeah . George ? @!GEORGE-WILL-@1-ABC# @(Off-camera) George , backwards reels the mind to the 1980s and all of the stories , many of them quite true , about the conflicts between Nancy Reagan and certain members of the President 's staff , including his chief of staff , Donald Regan . Mrs Obama is black , she is a woman , and if she does n't get angry on occasion , she 's not human . She is human . End of story . @!JONATHAN-KARL-@1-A# @(Off-camera) You know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a positive portrayal . I mean , sure , there 's a few , you know , anecdotes . But it 's an overwhelming positive portrayal . She comes across as very real . I mean the whole idea that she considered staying in Chicago to let her kids finish school , I mean it 's like - that 's normal . @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) I felt bad for the President when I heard that . @!PEGGY-NOONAN-@1WAL# Amen to all that has been said , First Lady is a hard job , eventually they all feel like prisoners . They get written about . Everybody also wants to find some tensions between the East Wing and the West . They always find something . Let it go . @!PAUL-KRUGMAN-@1NEW# And what strikes me is how incredibly scandal-free this administration has been . That some harsh words said on a couple of occasions is a scandal ? My gosh . @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) Meanwhile , the talk about a former first lady continues . We get a question on Twitter on this , it came from Jennifer Moore . @GRAPHICS @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Voiceover) " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any chance we may see Hillary step in as VP ? " @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) Now , George , I 'm going to start with you on this . And what I ca n't figure out is why this conversation continues . I mean , as far as I can tell , it has never been considered in the Oval Office , never been considered by the First Lady , never been considered by Vice President Biden . Yet the talk goes on and on and on . @!GEORGE-WILL-@1-ABC# @(Off-camera) Well , it goes on and on and on among the professionally talking classes . It makes some sense in this particular , if you laid a map over the places where the Democrats lost congressional seats in 2010 it would fairly much replicate where Hillary Democrats outpolled Obama Democrats during the 2008 primary . So , there 's a sense in which she could connect with the kind of working-class Democrats who are now Reagan Democrats or now trending to become Republicans . So , it makes it kind of a sense . But , frankly , George , I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eleventh presidential campaign in Washington , I have never met anyone who said they voted for Presidential Candidate A because of Running Mate B. @!COKIE-ROBERTS-@1-A# @(Off-camera) Well , the only evidence that we have that it ever happened was with Lyndon Johnson in 1960 where he was able to carry Texas and therefore the election . @!JONATHAN-KARL-@1-A# @(Off-camera) There is enough evidence that enough people voted against Sarah Palin . @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) Sarah Palin , some evidence , yeah . @!PEGGY-NOONAN-@1WAL# Yeah , there actually is. @!COKIE-ROBERTS-@1-A# @(Off-camera) But the truth is , the reason that this continues in my view , George , is because we talked about the enthusiasm gap on the Republican side , but there 's an enthusiasm gap on the Democratic side as well . And so there is - the people who talk about putting Hillary Clinton in , are people who think that will help get voters excited about a Democratic ticket . As you say , it is total fantasy . @!JONATHAN-KARL-@1-A# @(Off-camera) It probably would , right ? I mean - no ? @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# No , people think politics is magic . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put in somebody else and everything becomes electric and electrified . It 's not like that . The President apparently does n't want to do this . The vice president does n't . Hillary does n't . There 's no talk anywhere in Washington of seriously doing this . But the campaign strategists on the comment threads of our great nation are all very hot to do it . @!JONATHAN-KARL-@1-A# @(Off-camera) There you go letting the facts get in the way of a story . @!PEGGY-NOONAN-@1WAL# Well , I did n't mean to . @!PAUL-KRUGMAN-@1NEW# And one more thing , everything that I hear , and I talk to people who are pretty seriously involved is that she 's a terrific secretary of State . And why would she trade that huge career success for a bucket of orange ... @!PEGGY-NOONAN-@1WAL# To get into this ... @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) To be in line to run in 2016 if she chose to ? @!JONATHAN-KARL-@1-A# @(Off-camera) There you go , George , for making the argument . @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) I 'm not making the argument . I do not believe it was going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of - you know , I was talking to Clint Eastwood a few weeks back . It turns out that back in 1988 James Baker actually considered for a nanosecond , replacing - putting Clint Eastwood on the ticket in ' 88 , but that went away as well . @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) Finally last night , big football game . Blowout , Tim Tebow 's season finally ended . And here 's what he had to say about it . @!TIM-TEBOW-@1DENVER# It still was n't a bad day . It still was a good day , because , you know , before the game , I got to spend time with Zach McLeod and make him smile . And overall , when you get to do that , it 's still a positive day and it 's still a good day . Sometimes it 's just hard to see , but it depends on what lens your looking through . @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) George , that smile and that attitude is somewhat appealing , but how do you explain how Tim Tebow became such a polarizing figure this season ? @!GEORGE-WILL-@1-ABC# @(Off-camera) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Tigers and Sandy Koufax and Sean Greene of the Dodgers , all three Jewish missed extremely important late-season games because of observance of Yom Kippur , no one said this was exhibitionism and no one complained about it . They thought it was exemplary . As far as I can tell , in every particular Tim Tebow is an exemplary gentleman . And maybe this is just the democratic small d , democratic nation 's itch to level people . It 's unattractive the attacks on Tebow from whatever source . @!COKIE-ROBERTS-@1-A# @(Off-camera) I just want to say that God , however , is not a Broncos fan . I think we just have to make that clear . His team is the Saints . And you know , as the archbishop said when the Saints were named the Saints , Archbishop Hannan was asked if that was disrespectful and he said no , but just remember that most saints are martyrs . @!PEGGY-NOONAN-@1WAL# You know , Tebow is just about the most popular sports figure in America right now . @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) Clearly . @!PEGGY-NOONAN-@1WAL# He 's not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ folks like us , we talk about the controversy . But this guy is loved . He has come up and across the past few months as a kind of refreshment as an inspiration . And after all of the terrible scandals in sports and outside the past few six months , say , or the past year , he comes as an antidote and somebody parents can point out for their children and say , that 's a good man . See that man ? @!JONATHAN-KARL-@1-A# @(Off-camera) And then when it comes to football , I mean he 's controversial . He 's decisive even among football analysts , because he 's not your typical NFL quarterback . But this guy is good . He already has as many playoff wins as Tony Romo . After 15 games , he 's had 15 starts . He already has a better record than Aaron Rodgers had after 15 starts , than Drew Brees , sorry Cokie , had after 15 starts . He 's going to be around . He 's going to be a force . And all the - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . @!PAUL-KRUGMAN-@1NEW# I have been keeping my commentary Tebow-free . And I 'm going to maintain that . @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) You 're going to maintain that . @!**29;134;TOOLONG @(Off-camera) Okay George , we have a little over a minute left . And I do n't want to end the program without giving you a chance to weigh in on Steve Colbert . His take on Super PACs . You have been outspoken on the whole issue of Citizens United . @!GEORGE-WILL-@1-ABC# @(Off-camera) Well , Stephen Colbert is a better comedian and he 's an excellent one than he is a constitutional scholar . And in fact the Supreme Court has held over and over again that money is indispensable for the dissemination of speech , campaign reformers constantly argue that , A , there 's too much political speech in this country , B , they know the right amount and , C , they want to criminalize speech in excess of that . @!GEORGE-WILL-@1-ABC# @(Off-camera) Reformers spend so much of their time , George , regretting their reforms . Super PACs are a consequence of driving money away from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Do we have too much money in politics ? I 'm astonished how little money there is in politics considering the stakes of our politics in allocating wealth and opportunity . In about four weeks , George , people will begin doing in America what they do every year , spending about $2 billion on Easter candy . We spend less on politics . @!JONATHAN-KARL-@1-A# @(Off-camera) But George , it is distorting the system . Right now , we look at Super PAC money . In South Carolina , the Super PACs are spending twice as much as the campaigns themselves . Basically the campaigns have been outsourced to groups that do n't have to play by the same rules that the campaigns have to play by . @!GEORGE-WILL-@1-ABC# @(Off-camera) Outsourced . You have a problem ... @!PAUL-KRUGMAN-@1NEW# Believe ... @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) I wished we had more time . But we do n't . I hope you guys can continue this online .

##4103521 @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) And here now for an exclusive interview , the latest candidate . Comedian Stephen Colbert rocked the political world this Thursday . @!CLIP: " THE COLBERT REPORT " @!STEPHEN-COLBERT-@1# I am forming an exploratory committee to lay the groundwork for my possible candidacy for the President of the United States of South Carolina . I 'm doing it . Drop them , Jimmy . @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) Mr Colbert , welcome to " This Week . " You know , down in South Carolina , your campaign seemed to hit a brick wall right out of the gate ... @!STEPHEN-COLBERT-@1# Excuse me , I do n't have a campaign , George . I do n't mean to correct you . I have an exploratory committee ... @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) Exploratory committee ... @!STEPHEN-COLBERT-@1# ... for finding out whether there is a hunger for a Stephen Colbert campaign right now . @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) Well , we ... @!STEPHEN-COLBERT-@1# Do n't force me into a campaign yet . I realize you 're a political operative , but there are stages to this , George . @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) Not in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to say about it . @GRAPHICS @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Voiceover) There is no blank space on voting machines to write-in a candidate . Stephen Colbert has about as much a chance of being elected president in South Carolina as he does of being elected pope . Zero . @!STEPHEN-COLBERT-@1# First of all , I 'm a Roman Catholic and I teach Sunday school . So I 'd say , I have a pretty good shot of being pope . A better shot than Matt Moore does , down in South Carolina . @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) You 're married , are n't you ? @!STEPHEN-COLBERT-@1# Excuse me ? @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) You 're married , are n't you ? @!STEPHEN-COLBERT-@1# George , are we going to get into our private lives right now ? Are you married ? @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) Yes , I am. @!STEPHEN-COLBERT-@1# You are , okay . @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) But I 'm not going to be pope or a president . Are you running or not ? @!STEPHEN-COLBERT-@1# I have an exploratory committee to be pope right now , George . And that 's after I have my exploratory committee to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ballot in South Carolina ? Is that what he 's saying ? @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) Yep , no write-in. @!STEPHEN-COLBERT-@1# They said you ca n't go to the moon . They said you ca n't put cheese inside a pizza crust . But NASA did it . They had to , because the cheese kept on floating off in space . @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) Well , this is not your first time looking at a presidential run . @!STEPHEN-COLBERT-@1# I 'm doing it , Tim , because I think our country is facing unprecedented challenges in the future , and I think that the junctures that we face , are both critical and unforeseen. @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) Last time , you tried to run , though , as a Democrat . Now you 're looking at running as a Republican . Is n't that the biggest flip-flop ever ? @!STEPHEN-COLBERT-@1# No , George , I got burned by the Democratic Party in 2008 . I ca n't go back to even contemplate that . I thought that the Republicans would be more welcoming than the Democrats . But it turns out in America @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , it 's who you know . And if the Republicans are trying to keep me out , if the Republicans will not allow even a write-in candidate in South Carolina , well , that does n't sound like freedom to me. @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) So what does that mean ... @!STEPHEN-COLBERT-@1# Excuse me , George , I was talking . @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) You finished your point . Let make mine . What does that mean if you do not get the Republican nomination for president , if you choose not to run in South Carolina ? Will you run as a third-party candidate ? @!STEPHEN-COLBERT-@1# Well , there are already a couple of third-party candidates out there possibly . Trump is thinking about going third party , Ron Paul might go third party . So I might just leap to like fourth of fifth party . @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) He all but ruled it out when I talked to him last week . @!STEPHEN-COLBERT-@1# What ? @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) He all but ruled it out when I talked to him last week . @!STEPHEN-COLBERT-@1# Who ? @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) Ron Paul . @!STEPHEN-COLBERT-@1# @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . So I think I might go as a fourth or fifth party candidate , George . @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) So you 're open to running through this whole year . @!STEPHEN-COLBERT-@1# This is an exploratory . When you 're exploring , you do n't know what you 're going to find . @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) The voting is in six days in South Carolina . @!STEPHEN-COLBERT-@1# Well , George , I mean , just because something 's difficult does n't mean it should n't be worth doing . You know , I 'm exploring right now . I 'm a one-man Lewis and Clark . And I 'm just looking for my Sacagawea. @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) What will your decision turn on ? @!STEPHEN-COLBERT-@1# Excuse me ? @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) What will your decision turn on ? @!STEPHEN-COLBERT-@1# If there 's a hunger for Stephen Colbert out there , that 's what we 're exploring . Or , George , if I find out in my exploratory phase that one of the other candidates might be better for the United States than a Stephen Colbert . Then I 've got 5% in South @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind one of the other candidates . All they have to do is come kiss my ring like they did Donald Trump 's . And they can come visit me this week if they want . @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) You 're serious about this pope thing . But I want to turn to what your supporters are saying . There is a Super PAC supporting you in South Carolina . @!STEPHEN-COLBERT-@1# Yes . @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) They released a new ad overnight taking a very tough shot at Mitt Romney. @!STEPHEN-COLBERT-@1# I have n't seen the - I have not seen this ad. @!NARRATOR-@1POLITIC# If Mitt Romney really believes ... @!MITT-ROMNEY-@1REPU# Corporations are people , my friend . @!NARRATOR-@1POLITIC# ... then Mitt Romney is a serial killer .

That 's powerful stuff . @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) Does n't that cross the line ? @!STEPHEN-COLBERT-@1# I have nothing to do with that ad . I have no control over that ad . If anything in that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corporations are people , " and if he did not make his money cutting up ... @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) You 're calling him a serial killer . @!STEPHEN-COLBERT-@1# ... corporate - I am not calling anybody a serial killer . I ca n't tell Americans for a Better Tomorrow tomorrow what to do . It 's not my Super PAC , George . It 's the Super PAC of , and I hope I 'm pronouncing this correctly , Jon " Stew-air " ? I believe it 's a soft " T. " But , listen , if that 's not accurate , I hope they take it down . I do n't know if Mitt Romney is a serial killer . That 's a question he 's gon na have to answer . But I know one thing , that sounds like it 's superstar actor Jon Lithgow voicing that . And he played a serial killer on " Dexter . " Two points make a line . @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) But you 're like Newt Gingrich . If it 's untrue , you want it to come down ... @!STEPHEN-COLBERT-@1# Absolutely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Super PAC supporting him . @!STEPHEN-COLBERT-@1# I do not want any untrue ads on the air that could in any way be traced back to me. @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) We 've got some questions from viewers on Facebook . Matthew Topper wants to know " Who will your VP be ? " @GRAPHICS @!STEPHEN-COLBERT-@1# George , see , you 're pushing me into being a candidate . @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) Time is running short . @!STEPHEN-COLBERT-@1# I 'm in an exploratory phase right now . I 'm still putting together my exploratory committee . And I 'm looking - would you be willing to be on my exploratory committee ? @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) No , I can not be on your exploratory committee , nor would I be willing to ... @!STEPHEN-COLBERT-@1# Why can you not be on my exploratory committee ? @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) ... to run for vice president . But who are you looking at for vice president ? @!STEPHEN-COLBERT-@1# Well , I - George , I certainly - I 'm looking at myself right now . You know , I read " The New York Times " last week that there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guys might be a good vice presidential candidate . If I 'm running , and I 'm not ... @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) You have to be born in two different states , according to the Constitution . @!STEPHEN-COLBERT-@1# Really ? Well , I was born in Washington , DC , which is n't a state at all . So I think I 've got it covered all around . @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) The second question from Facebook comes from Sharon Smith , it reads ... @GRAPHICS @!STEPHEN-COLBERT-@1# I love that Facebook . That thing is growing . @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Voiceover) They are . " How does Mrs. Colbert feel about the possibility of having her husband run for president ? " @!STEPHEN-COLBERT-@1# Mrs Colbert is n't on the exploratory committee . And , I think she 's probably going to find out about it by watching the show today . So , honey , we might be running for president , sorry about that . I should have told you before I came on air . @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) What is your guess on how she feels about it ? @!STEPHEN-COLBERT-@1# She would make a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Finally , Wanda Renee ... @!STEPHEN-COLBERT-@1# Wanda Renee ? @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) Wanda Renee. @!STEPHEN-COLBERT-@1# I know Wanda , she 's a good woman . @GRAPHICS @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Voiceover) Also on Facebook ... @!STEPHEN-COLBERT-@1# Really ? Do you get your questions from anywhere but Facebook ? @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Voiceover) No , we got a few of them from Facebook , though . " Do you believe the outcome of the 2012 presidential election is based on how much money each candidate can raise ? " @!STEPHEN-COLBERT-@1# No , it 's how much speech they can express , because money equals speech . It does n't matter if the speech comes from money or comes from your mouth . @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) So you agree with the Supreme Court ? @!STEPHEN-COLBERT-@1# On almost everything . Money equals speech , therefore , the more money you have the more you can speak . That 's just - that just stands to reason . If corporations are people , corporations should be able to speak . That 's why I believe in Super PACs. @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) So you believe in Super PACs . You believe they 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubt , do you not , George ? Do you not believe that some - are you saying ... @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) I 'm asking the questions today , Mr Colbert. @!STEPHEN-COLBERT-@1# Well , you answer one of my questions , I 'll answer one of yours . Do you believe that corporations are people ? @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) I am not going to weigh in on that . We 're going to have a long campaign here . But I want to know what you think about that . @!STEPHEN-COLBERT-@1# Really ? Corporations are people . You wo n't weigh in on whether some people are people . That seems kind of racist , George . @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) I am going to move on because one of your top supporters ... @!STEPHEN-COLBERT-@1# Really , I bet you will . @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) One of your top supporters got in a little hot water , Jon Stewart , you just called him Jon " Stew-air , " he 's running now ... @!STEPHEN-COLBERT-@1# Again , I 'm not familiar with him . @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) He 's running your Super PAC . But listen to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ News , said about him . @GRAPHICS @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Voiceover) He said that Stewart " hates conservative views , he hates conservative thoughts , he hates conservative verbiage , he hates conservatives , he 's crazy . If it was n't polarized he could n't make a living . He makes a living by attacking conservatives and stirring up a liberal base against it . " @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) It 's not going to help you all that much in South Carolina to have someone who , according to Roger Ailes , hates conservatives supporting you . @!STEPHEN-COLBERT-@1# No , Roger is a friend . We hit the steam room together a lot . And I usually do his back . I agree with Roger . I mean , that 's why I 'm disavowing anything that Jon Stewart does that is not accurate . I believe that Jon Stewart is a loose cannon . I believe that he 's a liberal . I believe that he has it in for conservatives . And that 's why I think if any of these ads are inaccurate , if any of these ads cause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my exploratory committee , because , again , I do n't have a Super PAC anymore . That 's Jon Stewart 's Super PAC . It 's one of the reasons why it 's so hard to form this exploratory committee , George . I had to give away my Super PAC . That is my baby . You know how hard it is to give away your baby ? @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) That must have hurt . It hurt . @!STEPHEN-COLBERT-@1# Now imagine if that baby also had a whole lot of money , how much harder would it make it to give away your baby ? Because you might get the baby back , but it may not have the same amount of money when you gave the baby away . @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) I 'm going to try to get serious here . I do n't know how much ... @!STEPHEN-COLBERT-@1# Good luck with that . @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) ... success I 'm going to have here . @!STEPHEN-COLBERT-@1# Good luck . @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) But what difference do you hope to make with this mock campaign ? @!STEPHEN-COLBERT-@1# It 's not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @!STEPHEN-COLBERT-@1# Exploratory committee . And it is not mock . It is a real exploratory committee . As a matter of fact , I will be the first person to ever actually have committee members on my exploratory committee . We 're going to have someone who 's good with explosives . We 're going to have a guy who 's a mountain climber . And we 're going to have a brain in a jar . @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) So you are - but are you worried about how much money , what money is doing to this political environment ? @!STEPHEN-COLBERT-@1# No . Why would you worry about what money is doing to the political environment ? There are $11.2 million in Super PAC ads being run in South Carolina . Super PACs are outspending the candidates two to one in South Carolina right now . That just means , according to Citizens United , there 's just more speech than there was before . And I do n't know about you , but I believe in the freedom of speech , especially as a member of the press , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decision coming ? @!STEPHEN-COLBERT-@1# George , again , I know that it 's your job to try to get a story , but I ca n't tell you what I 've found yet because I 've just started exploring . You know , did Queen Isabella say , go to America , and then say , have you found anything ? Like , I have n't even gotten on the Nina and the Pinta and the Santa Maria yet .

Sorry . @!CYNTHIA-MCFADDEN-@# @(Off-camera) Still , after all these years . @!MADONNA-@1SINGER@2# Why not ? @!CYNTHIA-MCFADDEN-@# @(Voiceover) Speaking of all these years , Madonna and I have our own history , nearly a decade 's worth , from our first interview in Los Angeles ... @!MADONNA-@1SINGER@2# Is Cynthia here ? @!CYNTHIA-MCFADDEN-@# @(Voiceover) ... to the one at her home in New York . @!MADONNA-@1SINGER@2# I 'm being held prisoner by hair and makeup artists . @!CYNTHIA-MCFADDEN-@# @(Voiceover) We last met in the south of France . @!MADONNA-@1SINGER@2# Come on , Cynthia .

Lots ... @!MADONNA-@1SINGER@2# Are n't people tired of that subject ? @!CYNTHIA-MCFADDEN-@# @(Off-camera) No. @!CYNTHIA-MCFADDEN-@# @(Voiceover) His name is Brahim Zaibat , a 24-year-old French dancer . @!MADONNA-@1SINGER@2# I just met someone that I cared for and this happens to be his age . @!CYNTHIA-MCFADDEN-@# @(Off-camera) And what 's appealing about him ? @!MADONNA-@1SINGER@2# I do n't feel comfortable with this conversation . @!CYNTHIA-MCFADDEN-@# @(Off-camera) What are you looking for ? @!MADONNA-@1SINGER@2# Let 's talk about Wallis Simpson . @!CYNTHIA-MCFADDEN-@# @(Off-camera) We 'll talk about Wallis Simpson . @!CYNTHIA-MCFADDEN-@# @(Voiceover) So how is her relationship going ? @!MADONNA-@1SINGER@2# I 'm the easy one . @!CYNTHIA-MCFADDEN-@# @(Off-camera) I believe you .

Fame kind of came and smacked me in the face . And I set out to be a dancer , and then I set out to be a singer and a songwriter. @!CYNTHIA-MCFADDEN-@# @(Voiceover) And now , a director . When we come back ... @!CYNTHIA-MCFADDEN-@# @(Off-camera) They wan na know what you think about Lady Gaga. @!CYNTHIA-MCFADDEN-@# @(Voiceover) Your number one question for the Queen of Pop . @!CYNTHIA-MCFADDEN-@# @(Off-camera) Is that good ? @!MADONNA-@1SINGER@2# Look it up . @!CYNTHIA-MCFADDEN-@# @(Voiceover) When " 20/20 's Ask Madonna " continues . @!COMMERCIAL-BREAK-# @!CYNTHIA-MCFADDEN-@# @(Voiceover) This is the first time in 30 years Madonna has ever allowed cameras into a recording studio . @!MADONNA-@1SINGER@2# I know it 's not cool to be happy , but ...

I think we 've passed dinner . @GRAPHICS @GRAPHICS @!CYNTHIA-MCFADDEN-@# @(Voiceover) Madonna is also the halftime entertainment at this year 's Super Bowl , a controversial decision . @!CYNTHIA-MCFADDEN-@# @(Off-camera) So what 's more frightening , having the movie open or performing live at the Super Bowl ? @!MADONNA-@1SINGER@2# The Super Bowl for sure . I have eight minutes to set up my stage , 12 minutes to put on the greatest show on Earth , and I have seven minutes to take it down . And that 's the challenge . How do you do that ? @!CYNTHIA-MCFADDEN-@# @(Off-camera) Jump out of a plane . No. @!MADONNA-@1SINGER@2# No . There 's a roof on the stadium . It would be painful . I actually wanted to have 100 drummers come from the ceiling . @!CYNTHIA-MCFADDEN-@# @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right ? @!CYNTHIA-MCFADDEN-@# @(Off-camera) Yeah . @!CYNTHIA-MCFADDEN-@# @(Voiceover) Madonna would n't tell me exactly what she 's planning . @!CYNTHIA-MCFADDEN-@# @(Off-camera) What 's happening now ? @!MADONNA-@1SINGER@2# I have 250 dancers waiting for me right now . @!CYNTHIA-MCFADDEN-@# @(Voiceover) The day we talked , she was holding a massive audition .

What was the last meal you cooked entirely by yourself ? @!MADONNA-@1SINGER@2# I do n't think I 've ever cooked a meal entirely by myself . @!CYNTHIA-MCFADDEN-@# @(Off-camera) Ever ? @!MADONNA-@1SINGER@2# My nannies cook . My housekeeper cooks . @!CYNTHIA-MCFADDEN-@# @(Off-camera) Do you cook anything ? @!MADONNA-@1SINGER@2# No . But I do everything else . @!CYNTHIA-MCFADDEN-@# @(Off-camera) Do you miss being married ? @!MADONNA-@1SINGER@2# Certain parts of it , yeah . Mm-hmm . @!CYNTHIA-MCFADDEN-@# @(Off-camera) What parts ? @!MADONNA-@1SINGER@2# Just feeling like a part of a family unit , not having to make all the decisions on my own . @!MADONNA-@1SINGER@2# @(Off-camera) Which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a world without sex or a world full of hydrangeas ? @!MADONNA-@1SINGER@2# A world without sex , because when you 're making love to someone , it 's like music . @!CYNTHIA-MCFADDEN-@# @(Off-camera) That 's nice . @!MADONNA-@1SINGER@2# Mm-hmm . Yep . As long as there 's no hydrangeas in the room . @!CYNTHIA-MCFADDEN-@# @(Off-camera) So of all these , there 's one question that almost blew up the internet. @!MADONNA-@1SINGER@2# Oh . @!CYNTHIA-MCFADDEN-@# @(Off-camera) They wan na know what you think about Lady Gaga. @!CYNTHIA-MCFADDEN-@# @(Voiceover) Do you feel she 's copying you ? @!MADONNA-@1SINGER@2# I certainly think she references me a lot in her work . Sometimes I think it 's amusing and flattering and well done . I ca n't really be annoyed by it or insulted by it because , obviously , I 've influenced her . @!CYNTHIA-MCFADDEN-@# @(Voiceover) It does n't feel like a rip-off ? @!MADONNA-@1SINGER@2# No , because she 's she , and I 'm me. @!CYNTHIA-MCFADDEN-@# @(Off-camera) Would you ever do a duet with her ? @!MADONNA-@1SINGER@2# It has n't occurred to me . But never say never . @!CYNTHIA-MCFADDEN-@# @(Off-camera) And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did you think ... @!MADONNA-@1SINGER@2# When I heard it on the radio , yes , I did . I said that sounds very similar , yes . @!CLIP-FROM-LADY-GAG# @!CYNTHIA-MCFADDEN-@# @(Voiceover) Some argue " Born This Way " sounds a little too much like Madonna 's " Express Yourself . " @!CLIP-FROM-MADONNA ' # @!CYNTHIA-MCFADDEN-@# @(Off-camera) And that does n't feel annoying ? @!MADONNA-@1SINGER@2# It feels reductive. @!CYNTHIA-MCFADDEN-@# @(Off-camera) Is that good ? @!MADONNA-@1SINGER@2# Look it up . @!CYNTHIA-MCFADDEN-@# @(Voiceover) We did . It means simplified or crude . @!CYNTHIA-MCFADDEN-@# @(Off-camera) That was a good answer . @!ELIZABETH-VARGAS-@# @(Off-camera) Well , that 's our program for tonight , but be sure to stay tuned for " Nightline " after your local news . I 'm Elizabeth Vargas . For all of us at " 20/20 " and ABC News , have a great weekend and good night . 
##4103523 @!ELIZABETH-VARGAS-@# @(Off-camera) Good evening . Women are looking for it and men are giving it away . The means with which to have a baby , that is. @GRAPHICS @!ELIZABETH-VARGAS-@# @(Off-camera) It 's part of what we 're calling the new sex . Donor-sexuals , volunteers willing to help a woman conceive . But are they doing it out of the goodness of their hearts or their gene pools or something else ? And what about the women ? What drives them to accept an exchange like you 've never seen before ? @!BETH-@1RICHARD'S-W# My monitor says that I have high day right now . So it 's a good day to inseminate. @!ELIZABETH-VARGAS-@# @(Voiceover) Like millions of couples , Beth and Richard are on a quest to have a baby . But unlike most , their labor of love is launching them on a cross-country odyssey . Their destination , a strange hotel room . @!BETH-@1RICHARD'S-W# That 's pretty much my whole gamut of fertility products . If you want a baby , it 's worth it . @!ELIZABETH-VARGAS-@# @(Voiceover) And an intimate encounter with a perfect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , says he 's on the way . Honey , can you help me with the pillows ? @!ELIZABETH-VARGAS-@# @(Off-camera) So why the need to get pregnant ? @!BETH-@1RICHARD'S-W# I 've really felt the need ever since we got married , almost nine years ago . @!ELIZABETH-VARGAS-@# @(Voiceover) Their saga started when they discovered Richard 's vasectomy could not be reversed . They spent years taking in more than 60 foster children and ended up adopting two of the neediest . But at 33 years of age , Beth still yearns to give birth herself . @!BETH-@1RICHARD'S-W# I sit around with my sisters and they tell me about their experiences . And I , I just wan na know what does it feel like , you know , to have that baby inside of you . @!ELIZABETH-VARGAS-@# @(Voiceover) After two years and $14,000 worth of sperm banks and artificial inseminations , Beth and Richard just could n't afford anymore . They 'd nearly lost hope . And then one day , Beth turned on her computer and clicked onto a brave new world . @!BETH-@1RICHARD'S-W# Some people go on the internet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ internet for sperm ? @!ELIZABETH-VARGAS-@# @(Off-camera) What did you Google ? Free sperm ? @!BETH-@1RICHARD'S-W# Free sperm . @!ELIZABETH-VARGAS-@# @(Off-camera) You really can find everything on the internet. @!BETH-@1RICHARD'S-W# Yes , you really can . @!ELIZABETH-VARGAS-@# @(Voiceover) To Beth 's surprise , it turns out there 's an entire online universe devoted to free sperm donation . @!CLIP-FROM- " THE-SWI# @!JENNIFER-ANISTON-@# So , I want a donor that I can meet . @!ELIZABETH-VARGAS-@# @(Voiceover) Just like in the movies . @!JENNIFER-ANISTON-@# You know , shake his hand , and you ca n't do that at a sperm bank , right ? I also want it fresh , you know ? I do n't really , do n't think I want it frozen . @!ELIZABETH-VARGAS-@# @(Voiceover) There are dozens of websites , like the Free Sperm Donor Registry . @!BETH-GARDNER-@1FOU# Having a child is a big deal . And there 's a lot of people out there saying , I do n't wan na have a child with somebody that I have n't talked to , that I ca n't meet face-to-face . @!ELIZABETH-VARGAS-@# @(Voiceover) Beth Gardner founded **26;202;TOOLONG . It offers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sperm to thousands of women desperate to conceive . @!TONY-DOKOUPIL-@1SE# They have chat rooms . They have forums . @!ELIZABETH-VARGAS-@# @(Off-camera) What , do I click on something and a picture pops up ? @!TONY-DOKOUPIL-@1SE# Yeah , you get a picture . You know , you can , where they 're born , where they went to college . @!ELIZABETH-VARGAS-@# @(Voiceover) Reporter Tony Dokoupil spent months investigating this new online world for a " Newsweek " cover story . @!TONY-DOKOUPIL-@1SE# It 's a weird blend of Facebook , Match.com and a traditional sperm bank where you get all this medical information about this person who you might procreate with . @!ELIZABETH-VARGAS-@# @(Voiceover) Tony estimates thousands of people use these sites . His research took him to some unexpected places where people donate sperm . @!TONY-DOKOUPIL-@1SE# A fairly common location for the exchange is Starbucks. @!ELIZABETH-VARGAS-@# @(Off-camera) Starbucks ? @!TONY-DOKOUPIL-@1SE# Starbucks has a lot of locations . @!ELIZABETH-VARGAS-@# @(Voiceover) In the middle of Starbucks ? @!TONY-DOKOUPIL-@1SE# Yeah . This will be happening right in that one bathroom they always have to occupy . @!ELIZABETH-VARGAS-@# @(Off-camera) And you use a cup that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I mean , they 'll - use a sterile cup . @!ELIZABETH-VARGAS-@# @(Off-camera) Okay . @!TONY-DOKOUPIL-@1SE# You can get them at a drugstore. @!ELIZABETH-VARGAS-@# @(Off-camera) Mm-hmm . @!TONY-DOKOUPIL-@1SE# Hand the cup to the recipient ... @!ELIZABETH-VARGAS-@# @(Off-camera) Mm-hmm . @!TONY-DOKOUPIL-@1SE# ... who will then go into the bathroom . @!ELIZABETH-VARGAS-@# @(Voiceover) And they do n't even have to leave the bathroom to inseminate before the sperm cells start dying within minutes , thanks to a handy device known as an Instead cup . @!TONY-DOKOUPIL-@1SE# It fits on the cervix . So you , you put the sample in the Instead cup and then insert the fixture . @!ELIZABETH-VARGAS-@# @(Off-camera) Mm-hmm . @!TONY-DOKOUPIL-@1SE# And then you can walk around freely while nature 's taking its course . @!ELIZABETH-VARGAS-@# @(Voiceover) A few months ago , Beth discovered the Free Sperm Donor Registry and a donor named Drew Sollenberger. @!DREW-SOLLENBERGER-# I listed myself on that site . And fairly quickly , I started getting contacts from multiple individuals . @!ELIZABETH-VARGAS-@# @(Voiceover) Drew is a brilliant 26-year-old software engineer who does work for government agencies . He 's also a member of the brotherhood who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ selling it to sperm banks . @!ELIZABETH-VARGAS-@# @(Off-camera) Why not go to a sperm bank and donate there ? Why do this over the internet and for free ? @!DREW-SOLLENBERGER-# I prefer to know the child if at all possible . As someone who loves children , I still wanted to have a child . @!ELIZABETH-VARGAS-@# @(Off-camera) But do you wan na get married and have your own kids ? @!DREW-SOLLENBERGER-# I do n't suspect that I will ever choose to get married . @!ELIZABETH-VARGAS-@# @(Off-camera) Why not ? @!DREW-SOLLENBERGER-# I am , by nature , a bit of an introvert . @!ELIZABETH-VARGAS-@# @(Off-camera) You know that there is probably out there a bit of an assumption that guys like you are , you know , a little ... @!DREW-SOLLENBERGER-# Many people do distrust sperm donors . There are some who do this for the wrong reasons . But there are many good donors . @!ELIZABETH-VARGAS-@# @(Voiceover) Drew is an extreme altruist who donates thousands of dollars to charity and even donated one of his kidneys to a child . Today , Drew is traveling to a Maryland hotel room . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @(Voiceover) Beth and Richard have come here all the way from Wyoming to inseminate with the man they 've never before met. @!ELIZABETH-VARGAS-@# @(Off-camera) I 'm just curious . What do you use ? I mean , in the movies , you see a turkey baster. @!BETH-@1RICHARD'S-W# You just use a regular syringe . Draw in the semen with the syringe . You lay down on the bed , prop your hips up . What do you say ? Come on in. @!DREW-SOLLENBERGER-# Thank you . @!BETH-@1RICHARD'S-W# This is my husband , Richard . @!DREW-SOLLENBERGER-# Hi . @!RICHARD-@1BETH'S-H# How are you doing ? @!DREW-SOLLENBERGER-# Nice to meet you . @!RICHARD-@1BETH'S-H# Nice to meet you too . @!ELIZABETH-VARGAS-@# @(Off-camera) Why were you so convinced that Drew should be your donor ? @!BETH-@1RICHARD'S-W# I had talked to him . He told me what he believed . He told me about the charities he gave to . I knew he was n't there for the wrong reasons . I just knew he was a good guy . And I knew that I wanted to work with him . @!ELIZABETH-VARGAS-@# @(Voiceover) Beth and Drew conduct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good to meet you . @!ELIZABETH-VARGAS-@# @(Voiceover) She needs to know he will be good and safe as a partner . At a traditional sperm bank , there 's the assurance that the semen has been frozen for six months and thoroughly tested for diseases . That is not the case here . @!ELIZABETH-VARGAS-@# @(Off-camera) Now , how do you know , because you have n't had a sperm bank screening , Drew , how do you know this is safe ? @!BETH-@1RICHARD'S-W# When he donated his - kidney to a child , he had to be screened by the hospital for , I 'm sure , every possible disease . And he 's also been screened for STDs . And he 's given me that paperwork. @!ELIZABETH-VARGAS-@# @(Off-camera) But you 're really trusting . You 're out on a limb , basically trusting that he is who he says he is. @!BETH-@1RICHARD'S-W# Yeah . @!ELIZABETH-VARGAS-@# @(Voiceover) Armed with a good gut feeling , Beth is ready to go to the next step . @!BETH-@1RICHARD'S-W# Okay . So we 'll go downstairs then and I 'll have my phone on me. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @!DREW-SOLLENBERGER-# See you soon . @!BETH-@1RICHARD'S-W# All right . @!ELIZABETH-VARGAS-@# @(Voiceover) Drew retreats to the bathroom with a cup and his imagination . Downstairs , Beth and Richard do n't have to wait long for Drew 's text . @!BETH-@1RICHARD'S-W# Drew says he 's done . He 's ready for us. @!ELIZABETH-VARGAS-@# @(Voiceover) Now , it 's time for Beth to begin her part in the process . @!DREW-SOLLENBERGER-# Ready for you in there . @!BETH-@1RICHARD'S-W# Okay . Thanks . @!ELIZABETH-VARGAS-@# @(Off-camera) Is that a weird moment when Drew 's handing you this ... @!BETH-@1RICHARD'S-W# It 's a little bit different , but ... @!ELIZABETH-VARGAS-@# @(Voiceover) You do n't feel embarrassed ? He does n't feel embarrassed ? @!BETH-@1RICHARD'S-W# I think my husband feels more embarrassed than we do . @!ELIZABETH-VARGAS-@# @(Off-camera) Is that true , Richard ? @!RICHARD-@1BETH'S-H# Yeah , I 'm sure it is. @!BETH-@1RICHARD'S-W# All right . Well , thank you . @!DREW-SOLLENBERGER-# Thank you . @!BETH-@1RICHARD'S-W# We 'll see you tomorrow . Pretty much say , okay , goodbye , you know . Well , thank you , goodbye . I mean , how can you ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yeah . @!BETH-@1RICHARD'S-W# Okay . @!ELIZABETH-VARGAS-@# @(Voiceover) While Beth positions the pillows to ensure maximum effect ... @!BETH-@1RICHARD'S-W# Got a couple of pillows to put my hips up on . @!ELIZABETH-VARGAS-@# @(Voiceover) ... final delivery of this gift is entrusted to Richard . @!BETH-@1RICHARD'S-W# Slip off my shoes . So , we inseminated . And I have my hips up on the pillow underneath this big old burrito here . And my knees are right here . I just keep them up as long as possible . The syringe is still in . Will leave it in for probably about 15 minutes . Thank you for your support with this . @!RICHARD-@1BETH'S-H# Mm-hmm . @!BETH-@1RICHARD'S-W# I feel like it 's important for him to be there . @!ELIZABETH-VARGAS-@# @(Voiceover) Mm-hmm . @!BETH-@1RICHARD'S-W# That way , I can say he was there at conception . He will be the father of the baby . @!ELIZABETH-VARGAS-@# @(Voiceover) And Richard is there over the next five days ... @!BETH-@1RICHARD'S-W# Anything interesting ? @!RICHARD-@1BETH'S-H# No. @!ELIZABETH-VARGAS-@# @(Voiceover) ... as Beth and Drew repeat the now familiar ritual of insemination. @!BETH-@1RICHARD'S-W# Says he 's done . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if Beth is pregnant . @!ELIZABETH-VARGAS-@# @(Off-camera) You know that there are people out there watching this right now thinking ... @!BETH-@1RICHARD'S-W# We 're crazy ? @!ELIZABETH-VARGAS-@# @(Off-camera) You 're naive . @!RICHARD-@1BETH'S-H# Well , we are . @!BETH-@1RICHARD'S-W# Yeah . @!RICHARD-@1BETH'S-H# Yeah . @!BETH-@1RICHARD'S-W# Well , I mean , it is a leap of faith . But it 's what 's best for us . When you look at these babies that we 've adopted and all the struggles that they 've gone through , we love both of our babies so much , and we love their mothers for choosing us . That 's how I feel about Drew at this time , too . He 's giving me this gift that , how many other people would , would freely give ? @!ELIZABETH-VARGAS-@# @(Voiceover) When we come back , why is the government cracking down on this controversial donor , issuing a cease manufacture order to this one-man sperm bank ? Stay with us. @!COMMERCIAL-BREAK-# @!ELIZABETH-VARGAS-@# @(Voiceover) In the underground gallery of online sperm donors , no one even comes close to Trent Arsenault. @!TRENT-ARSENAULT-@1# Around 50 different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @!ELIZABETH-VARGAS-@# @(Voiceover) That 's right . 50 women a year , about three donations a week , a prolific output he says has resulted in 14 children over the past five years . A reclusive computer engineer who works out of his home for several major companies , Trent posts pictures of his offspring on his website . And he recently met one of them , a toddler named Jayden @(PH) . @!TRENT-ARSENAULT-@1# He 's pretty good , considering it says like ages 4 and up . I think the biggest misconception that people see when they hear about me as a donor is that the , the goal is , is to create hundreds or thousands of copies of myself . And , and , no , that is n't the , the case . I 've done community service work , I 've volunteered at church . And I think this is just another way to help the community . @!KRISTA-@1FINANCE-P# Will you ask him give me a call , please ? @!ELIZABETH-VARGAS-@# @(Voiceover) This afternoon , 39-year-old Krista is on her way to meet Trent . @!KRISTA-@1FINANCE-P# I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of journey . And I never thought this was the journey that I would have to take . @!ELIZABETH-VARGAS-@# @(Voiceover) Krista holds a good job in the financial industry , but something was missing . She and her partner spent nearly $10,000 on six cycles of unsuccessful frozen sperm inseminations. @!KRISTA-@1FINANCE-P# I always ask , why am I such a failure for not being able to sustain a pregnancy or get pregnant ? @!ELIZABETH-VARGAS-@# @(Voiceover) So Krista started looking at alternatives . She soon became convinced that fresh rather than frozen sperm offered a better shot at her dream . @!KRISTA-@1FINANCE-P# I was looking at the statistics . I realized that my chances would be a lot better using fresh sperm . So we found Trent online . @!ELIZABETH-VARGAS-@# @(Voiceover) It worked . Krista got pregnant by Trent twice but miscarried . She trusts him , she says , because he posts his medical history and STD test results . @!KRISTA-@1FINANCE-P# Trent is tested regularly . So I feel very comfortable using his sperm as much as I would working with the frozen sperm . @!ELIZABETH-VARGAS-@# @(Voiceover) So now , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he can to ensure the women get his best product . That means a strict physical regimen and a healthy dose of his special homemade fertility smoothies. @!TRENT-ARSENAULT-@1# I 'm putting organic blueberries into the smoothie jar . It has all kinds of ingredients that I think are , are beneficial to sperm count . Amino acids , fructose , they 're organic as well , which all play a part in improving sperm count and fertility and hopefully healthy babies . Obviously , the sperm need protein . I have it down to a science , I think . I have my sperm count tested , and it 's approximately four times higher than the average man . @GRAPHICS @GRAPHICS @!THENEWSEX-# @!ELIZABETH-VARGAS-@# @(Voiceover) Krista sends a text message . She 's on her way . @!TRENT-ARSENAULT-@1# She says , " Hi , Trent . We are coming up on your house . " That 's my cue to recover the semen . @!ELIZABETH-VARGAS-@# @(Voiceover) Trent gets ready to makes his donation in a sterile cup . @!TRENT-ARSENAULT-@1# Time is of the essence because every minute or so that passes by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's dying away . @!KRISTA-@1FINANCE-P# Hi . @!TRENT-ARSENAULT-@1# Hi . @!ELIZABETH-VARGAS-@# @(Voiceover) And then the handoff on Trent 's front porch . @!TRENT-ARSENAULT-@1# Well , good luck . @!KRISTA-@1FINANCE-P# Oh , thanks . Appreciate it . We 'll keep in touch , let you know what happens . Okay ? @!TRENT-ARSENAULT-@1# Yeah . I 'll keep my fingers crossed . @!KRISTA-@1FINANCE-P# All right . All right . @!ELIZABETH-VARGAS-@# @(Voiceover) In her car , Krista 's partner inseminates her with a drugstore syringe . And Krista rests in the backseat. @!KRISTA-@1FINANCE-P# It 's important that I remain in this position for a little while . It 's a very emotional time . It 's filled with a lot of hope and a lot of excitement . @!ELIZABETH-VARGAS-@# @(Voiceover) Trent 's work for the day is done , but not everyone is pleased with what he 's doing . The FDA is now involved , saying Trent is not following federal guidelines . They have issued a cease manufacture order , telling him to stop distributing his sperm . @!TRENT-ARSENAULT-@1# I would need written approval from the government before I could recover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is still in business and recently retained a lawyer to challenge the FDA 's order . The agency declined our request for an interview but did tell us , quote , " human cells and tissues intended for donation are regulated regardless of whether they are for sale or free of charge . " @!ELIZABETH-VARGAS-@# @(Off-camera) I know the FDA frowns on this . But is it illegal ? @!TONY-DOKOUPIL-@1SE# It 's effectively illegal . You need to have a battery of STD tests . The fees for those laboratories are more than $1,000 per attempt . Those standards are so arduous as to make it impossible for somebody like Trent Arsenault to , to meet . @!KRISTA-@1FINANCE-P# It 's not up to the government to determine who I decide the father to our child should be . If someone has the right to go to a bar in the evening and wind up having sexual intercourse , why is it they can do that and I ca n't choose to have this person be the biological contributor to my child ? @!ELIZABETH-VARGAS-@# @(Voiceover) Legal or not , there are alarming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ online donors . It turns out that over the years , Trent has posted dozens of graphic videos of himself . He says the videos are , quote , " part of his process . " But they raise serious concerns . @!DOCTOR-JESSICA-BRO# Out there online , not everything is as it represents itself to be . @!ELIZABETH-VARGAS-@# @(Voiceover) Dr. Jessica Brown is a fertility specialist who has helped women get pregnant for nearly 20 years . She says another thing sperm banks often do , besides STD testing , is screen donors for psychological issues . @!DOCTOR-JESSICA-BRO# It does make sense to try to weed out men who may be doing this for bizarre reasons or may have some type of , of psychiatric illness or personality disorder . @!ELIZABETH-VARGAS-@# @(Voiceover) And there is another big question about the donors . @!ELIZABETH-VARGAS-@# @(Off-camera) Are n't there concerns that he 's gon na want to exercise parental rights that I , I do n't want him to exercise ? Maybe I do n't want you around the Christmas tree every year . You know , I , I wanted your sperm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much and see you later . @!TONY-DOKOUPIL-@1SE# Virtually all these women have , have contracts that the donor signs where the donor relinquishes parental rights . Now , whether those are enforceable if the donor then decides , oh , actually I changed my mind , that 's a gray area . @!ELIZABETH-VARGAS-@# @(Voiceover) There is one more leap of faith some women are willing to take to have a baby . When we come back , donations that do n't come in a sterile cup . @!ELIZABETH-VARGAS-@# @(Off-camera) Does your wife know you 're doing this ? Stay with us. @!COMMERCIAL-BREAK-# @!ELIZABETH-VARGAS-@# @(Voiceover) In the private and secretive world of online insemination , there is a special category called natural insemination or NI . In other words , having sex with people you meet online specifically to get pregnant . @!TONY-DOKOUPIL-@1SE# At least a third of women click that they 're available for NI as an option . How many actually go through with it , I do n't know . @!ELIZABETH-VARGAS-@# @(Voiceover) To understand why some women would even consider that option , you need to meet Tanya . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a child . @!ELIZABETH-VARGAS-@# @(Voiceover) Tanya 's journey began when she was 19 years old . @!TANYA-@1LOOKING-FO# I got pregnant and I decided to place our child for adoption . It changed me forever . I have a hole in my heart . And if I could have another biological child , that I could have the chance to be her mom , it would at least , you know , make me feel a little bit better . @!ELIZABETH-VARGAS-@# @(Voiceover) In her 30s , Tanya had a longtime boyfriend . But when he told her he did n't want children , it crushed her heart but not her hope . She turned to sperm banks . @!TANYA-@1LOOKING-FO# I , unfortunately , had three miscarriages . @!ELIZABETH-VARGAS-@# @(Off-camera) How much money did you spend ? @!TANYA-@1LOOKING-FO# Probably 60 , $70,000 . I did n't have any infertility insurance at all . So I had to pay for everything out of pocket . @!ELIZABETH-VARGAS-@# @(Voiceover) This past summer after her third miscarriage , she still longed for a child . She went online . Tanya found the Free Sperm Donor Registry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insemination blank . @!TANYA-@1LOOKING-FO# So I just decided that I would see if this person was someone that I would be interested in and then we would make the decision . @!ELIZABETH-VARGAS-@# @(Voiceover) One online donor caught her interest . @!TANYA-@1LOOKING-FO# We spent weeks emailing and talking on the phone and really getting to know each other . @!ELIZABETH-VARGAS-@# @(Voiceover) Eventually , they agreed to meet . Tanya found herself conducting the strangest interview she could imagine , over dinner and a glass of wine . @!TANYA-@1LOOKING-FO# We were both shaking as we were lifting our wine glasses . @!ELIZABETH-VARGAS-@# @(Off-camera) Had he done this before ? @!TANYA-@1LOOKING-FO# He had not done this before . @!ELIZABETH-VARGAS-@# @(Off-camera) Really ? @!TANYA-@1LOOKING-FO# I know it 's hard to believe . @!ELIZABETH-VARGAS-@# @(Off-camera) It 's kind of a dogged pursuit of altruism , is n't it ? @!TANYA-@1LOOKING-FO# It is . And you 're like , why would you ever want to donate your sperm ? The way he explains it to me , he genuinely wanted to help someone . @!ELIZABETH-VARGAS-@# @(Off-camera) What kinds of questions did you ask ? @!TANYA-@1LOOKING-FO# We actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children to our 20s and college and ... @!ELIZABETH-VARGAS-@# @(Off-camera) It sounds like a date . @!TANYA-@1LOOKING-FO# For us , it actually turned out to be a date . @!ELIZABETH-VARGAS-@# @(Off-camera) It did ? @!TANYA-@1LOOKING-FO# It did . It really did . I hit the jackpot. @!ELIZABETH-VARGAS-@# @(Voiceover) In fact , she says they began to sleep together . @!ELIZABETH-VARGAS-@# @(Off-camera) Anybody wave some red flags , saying this is n't a good idea ? @!TANYA-@1LOOKING-FO# Definitely they did . @!ELIZABETH-VARGAS-@# @(Off-camera) So to people who think it 's crazy , you would say ? @!TANYA-@1LOOKING-FO# I thought it was crazy , you know , too . But people have one-night stands . And they have babies all the time . I made an adult choice . And he and I have come together for a common reason . @!ELIZABETH-VARGAS-@# @(Off-camera) Do you allow yourself now to imagine being a mom and to imagine this time holding your baby and keeping him or her ? @!TANYA-@1LOOKING-FO# I hope that that 's in my future . I definitely do . @!ELIZABETH-VARGAS-@# @(Voiceover) But for every hopeful novice like Tanya dabbling on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @(Off-camera) And half the time , you have sex with them ? @!JOE-@1SPERM-DONOR@# Yeah , sex . @!ELIZABETH-VARGAS-@# @(Voiceover) We 'll call him Joe . He asked that we disguise his face and his voice because he has a secret online life . He says he meets women often in hotel rooms who have sex with him because they believe natural insemination increases their chances of getting pregnant . @!ELIZABETH-VARGAS-@# @(Off-camera) And how many children total do you have ? @!JOE-@1SPERM-DONOR@# Right now , at least 10. @!ELIZABETH-VARGAS-@# @(Voiceover) And get this . He also has three kids and a wife at home . @!ELIZABETH-VARGAS-@# @(Off-camera) Does your wife know you 're doing this ? @!JOE-@1SPERM-DONOR@# No. @!ELIZABETH-VARGAS-@# @(Off-camera) Well , that begs the question , if there was n't something wrong , why keep it a secret ? @!JOE-@1SPERM-DONOR@# I 'm just helping these people do what they wan na do . And it 's the same thing that I want to do also . @!ELIZABETH-VARGAS-@# @(Off-camera) Right . But people want to have sex with other people sometimes and it 's called extramarital affairs . @!JOE-@1SPERM-DONOR@# I 'm not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pregnancy . @!ELIZABETH-VARGAS-@# @(Voiceover) Joe says he 's been doing this for three years and gets great satisfaction from impregnating women . He says he provides STD test results if the women ask for them . @!ELIZABETH-VARGAS-@# @(Off-camera) Why this need to have more kids ? A lot of people might not understand that . @!JOE-@1SPERM-DONOR@# I think a lot of people do . I mean , there 's some people who already have three , four kids , they want some more . @!ELIZABETH-VARGAS-@# @(Off-camera) Is this some , like , you know , man thing ? I mean , help me understand . @!JOE-@1SPERM-DONOR@# It 's just something that I feel is important . @!ELIZABETH-VARGAS-@# @(Off-camera) Are you trying to tell me that what you 're doing is altruistic ? @!JOE-@1SPERM-DONOR@# It 's what these people want . And it happens to coincide with what I want . I want more children . @!ELIZABETH-VARGAS-@# @(Off-camera) So it 's not altruistic . You 're doing this for yourself ? @!JOE-@1SPERM-DONOR@# Well , yeah . It 's a kind of win-win situation . @!ELIZABETH-VARGAS-@# @(Off-camera) And you do n't think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way ? @!JOE-@1SPERM-DONOR@# Well - these people are adults who 've asked me to help them . They 've decided how they want that to happen . @!ELIZABETH-VARGAS-@# @(Voiceover) Three men , each pursuing an online mission to procreate , and three women on a personal quest to have a baby by any means possible . Tanya tells us she is still dating and may also look into adopting . Krista , who got pregnant with Trent but miscarried soon after , says that despite revelations about his pornographic postings , she still believes in him as a donor . And they may try again . @!KRISTA-@1LOOKING-F# I actually have had no second thoughts with Trent . There 's a lot of risk involved . There 's a lot of unknowns . But he is the right choice for us . I know that I will be a mother someday . I just do n't know how yet . @!BETH-@1RICHARD'S-W# Yeah . Good girl . @!ELIZABETH-VARGAS-@# @(Voiceover) And remember Beth and her husband , Richard ?

##4103525 @!CLIP: " THE COLBERT REPORT " @!STEPHEN-COLBERT-@1# The Santorum surge just got real , ladies and gentlemen , because he has caught the notice of the most influential voice of the 19th Century , George Will , who published a pro-Santorum op-ed entitled , " Suddenly , a Fun Candidate . " Fun . And if anybody knows fun , it 's George Will . After all , a bow tie is just a necktie that 's doing this . @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) A new fan for George Will , Stephen Colbert. @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) It 's great to be back with you , George , also here with Jake Tapper , Mary Matalin , Matthew Dowd , and Donna Brazile . Well , George , you just heard Mike Huckabee right there . No one laid a glove on Mitt Romney . He said it was a NASCAR race , he was two laps ahead of the rest of the field . @!GEORGE-WILL-@1-ABC# @(Off-camera) He was . Part of the problem is the man who was supposed to wage the fight - well , first it was Gingrich who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lost his fire by the time he got here . But Rick Santorum , standing next to him , he 'd finally earned his place up here , had to face the fact that there 's not that much he differs with Romney on , except the social issues he does n't really want to talk about . He 's for No Child Left Behind . He was for the prescription drug entitlement . He is a protectionist . He is for industrial policy in that he wants special tax treatment for the 11% of the economy that 's manufacturing . What he does n't want to talk about is his involvement in the Terry Schiavo case , for example , the end of life tragedy that the federal government plunged into , and all the other issues that may have propelled him in Iowa but will not propel him beyond Iowa . @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) Mary Matalin , did Rick Santorum miss an opportunity last night ? @!MARY-MATALIN-@1REP# I do n't think so . That 's one part of his record . The other part of his record that you wrote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he has got a lot of attributes . He 's blue collar , he 's ethnic , he 's Catholic , that 's 38% of the voters here are Catholic . He is the one candidate in this field that 's connecting the cultural and the economic erosion to government expansion . And he 's getting - he 's a full-spectrum conservative . He showed that one side in Iowa . He pivoted here . He 's not getting out of this race . And I think he 's going to - he might even beat Paul in the state , I think . @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) That would be a big move for Rick Santorum , if he did . But Matt , take a shot at the question I asked Mike Huckabee . He said he could n't explain why the candidates did n't bring more fight to Mitt Romney last night , any kind of sustained attack . @!MATTHEW-DOWD-@1-AB# @(Off-camera) Well , all of us expected that they were going to do that because Mitt Romney is the frontrunner . And even Mitt Romney and his folks expected them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has a lot to do with this process of this race , which is unexpected people arriving in center stage when they really did not expect to be there . You started with Michele Bachmann who arrived on center stage then faded quickly . Rick Perry arrives on center stage , fades quickly . Herman Cain arrives on stage , fades quickly . Newt Gingrich arrives on stage , fades quickly . And now , Rick Santorum , this is the first time Rick Santorum was in the middle of the fight and I think he fanned , as you say , or as a lot of people have said . I think he may get his feet back under him as the days go on and think this is what I 've got to do . But I think it 's because this race has been so topsy-turvy , they have to sit , they 've got to sit still , and then they have to like move on . And nobody has been able to sort of move that forward . @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) And , Jake Tapper , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He has really staked his entire campaign on New Hampshire , spent more time here than anyone else . But his - perhaps his most memorable attack last night against Mitt Romney actually was in Chinese . @GRAPHICS @!JON-HUNTSMAN-@1REP# I think it 's important to note , as they would say in China , Mitt ( speaking in Mandarin ) , he does n't quite understand the situation . @!MITT-ROMNEY-@1REPU# Okay , I guess I lost . @GRAPHICS @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) I do n't know if we got the translation there . He does n't understand the situation . But Huntsman has to be able - has to jump ahead of Paul and/or Rick Santorum to really have any kind of an argument coming out of New Hampshire . @!JAKE-TAPPER-@1-ABC# @(Off-camera) First of all , everybody knows that the voters in New Hampshire speak Cantonese. @!JAKE-TAPPER-@1-ABC# @(Off-camera) So to go with Mandarin is a big mistake , big mistake tactically . Huntsman 's campaign , he did not bring it either . And as you say , he has staked everything here . And it was very - it was an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for him to talk about some key differences . And it was very bizarre to me to see the candidates pass up this opportunity to distinguish themselves , to draw the contrasts that they need to do . @!JAKE-TAPPER-@1-ABC# @(Off-camera) Now a lot of the campaigns were spinning after the debate . We did draw these distinctions . We did talk about it . And it 's true , if you - you know , go through the transcript , you can find little bits here and there . There was n't a coherent , I 'm Rick Santorum , I 'm the conservative , Mitt Romney is a nice guy , he 's a moderate , and he should not be the nominee of the party . Same thing with Rick Perry , Newt Gingrich . It was a mistake , it was a tactical mistake and they 're going to - you 're going to see them trying to rectify that in the coming days . @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) And you still have Mitt Romney facing a divided conservative opposition , Donna . @!DONNA-BRAZILE-@1-A# @(Off-camera) There 's no passion , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these debates to know what passion feels like , what it sounds like , and what it must ultimately be like for Republicans to beat President Obama in 2012 . Mitt Romney is the perfect candidate on paper , if you like to see something written on white paper with a couple of exclamation points . But when it comes to revving up the base , getting people excited , bringing more people into the party , Mitt Romney is not gon na bring anybody to the dance unless they 're already wearing boots . @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) And picking up on Donna 's point , George , you look back at the Iowa Caucuses this week , a few thousands more voters than voted in the Republican caucuses four years ago , but not an astronomical jump even though there was n't anything on the Democratic side . @!GEORGE-WILL-@1-ABC# @(Off-camera) That 's right . Because Iowa is on everyone 's list of 12 to 14 swing states that you have to carry to win the presidency , the Republicans should be alarmed at the - I wo n't call it depression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all know that the passion and the Republican Party is in the Tea Party , the Tea Party just is n't an important part of the Republican base , it is the base at this point . And there is no one on the stage - here I have to make my weekly **35;165;TOOLONG statement that Mrs Will is working for Mr Perry , the fact is , someone has to find the voice of the Tea Party . And the way you start that is by saying , what got us into trouble is n't Barack Obama , what got the Tea Party enkindled , so dry and flammable in February 2009 was the policies of the Bush administration . What you have to have now is an argument against big-government conservatism and Tea Party limited-government , 10th Amendment conservatism . @!MATTHEW-DOWD-@1-AB# @(Off-camera) George , to me - to me , I think the Obama folks are setting this race up like this . They have an expectation that it 's gon na be Mitt Romney . And they want to turn Mitt Romney into John Kerry 2004 . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incredibly vulnerable , like George Bush was in many Democrats minds , and try to turn Mitt Romney into the flip-flopper , John Kerry-like candidate from - interestingly enough , from Massachusetts . @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) The problem that the Obama administration and the Democrats have is this . While they always saw George Bush was vulnerable , here 's the situation Barack Obama faces in this election result . He is seven points lower on job approval was than George Bush was at this same time . He has a 30-point lower consumer confidence rating than George Bush had in 2004 , in January 2004 . And the wrong direction of this country is 40 points higher than it was in 2004 . And so the , the Obama campaign understands this . If this is about Barack Obama , they lose . They absolutely know they lose . They can not run a re-election campaign based on their own successes . If it 's about Mitt Romney or the other Republican , they know they have a fighting chance . @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) And that 's why - most of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Iowa is among those voters who think he is best positioned to beat President Obama . But , Mary , go at this question . There does seem to be this struggle inside the Republican Party between hearts and minds , purity and pragmatism , whatever you want to call it , this belief that Mitt Romney could be the strongest candidate but no real love for him . @!MARY-MATALIN-@1REP# There will be love for him . There will be passion , even in Iowa , which we were there and it was , kind of , humdrum . But the - if you look beyond the 100,000 , which the voting population is 3 million , the registration for Republicans has gone up and the registration for Democrats has gone down in that pivotal state . When we get a nominee , as the late , great Lee Atwater said , when you win , you 're in the winner 's circle , there will be plenty of passion . There has been intense and unrelenting passion against Obama since the spring of ' 09 . I know just being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But they 're all essentially for the same thing . And there 's - the being against is , kind of , the for , almost , in this case . There will be passion . A generic Republican has been beating Obama for months now . @!MATTHEW-DOWD-@1-AB# @(Off-camera) But I think part of the process , George - part of the process that I think is hurting Mitt Romney is he has not been fully tested . He has not exercised the muscles he needs to exercise to win a general election against a tremendous candidate . @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) He had a very - a string of solid debates but he has n't faced that sustained ... @!MATTHEW-DOWD-@1-AB# @(Off-camera) And he needs to basically prove his passion , prove that against somebody like Rick Santorum. @!DONNA-BRAZILE-@1-A# @(Off-camera) And you know , with self-inflicted wounds . Because the Republicans wo n't , you know , debate him , they wo n't touch him . I mean , in fact , last night , I sat down and said , okay , Ron Paul , secretary of defense , Jon Huntsman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ party chair , but Michele Bachmann also , Rick Santorum , ambassador to the Vatican - and Rick Perry , okay , Energy Department because he can eliminate his own job . @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) Meanwhile ... @!MATTHEW-DOWD-@1-AB# @(Off-camera) If he remembers . @!DONNA-BRAZILE-@1-A# @(Off-camera) If he - that 's right . @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) Jake , at the White House , they have been planning on Mitt Romney the entire year . They did the early ads against him . You know , Matt says they 're going to try to make him John Kerry , but it 's clear , also , they are going to make his business career front and center . And it 's a bit of a Rorschach test . There 's no question that Romney sees this as a real strength . It 's gon na be his major selling point . The White House sees it as his major weakness . @!JAKE-TAPPER-@1-ABC# @(Off-camera) They see Mitt Romney as the 1% in the 99% versus 1% , they see him . And , actually , you know , I 've even heard Republicans say to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm not - I do n't just mean like some liberal Republican , I mean , on the street , like deep-thinking , ultra-conservative Republicans , big strategists in Washington , say they do n't understand why Romney - why Romney is n't even trying to outflank Obama on some of the economic populism when it comes to corporate America , that corporate America does not necessarily need a tax break at this point . Why would he stake out that position ? He 's setting himself up for a fall . @!JAKE-TAPPER-@1-ABC# @(Off-camera) But , look , the fundamental point is that Obama is going to be the referendum . It 's - that 's what the election is next year . Should he - does he deserve a re-election or not ? If you look at 2008 , Barack Obama had everything going for him . His opponent did not run a great campaign , picked a running mate that alienated some key voters , you had an economic crisis as opposed to a national security crisis , everything going for him . You had the media perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) I think George agrees with that statement . @!JAKE-TAPPER-@1-ABC# @(Off-camera) And still , 47% of the country voted against him . All that Mitt Romney or whoever the nominee is needs to do is convince about 4 million or 5 million Americans ... @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) And there 's no question it will be a closer race this time . @!JAKE-TAPPER-@1-ABC# @(Off-camera) Yeah . @!GEORGE-WILL-@1-ABC# @(Off-camera) Just a historical footnote : Barack Obama , with all his advantages , got 53% of the vote . The Democrat Party is the oldest political party in the world . Only three Democrats have ever gotten more than 53% of the vote , Andrew Jackson , Franklin Roosevelt and Lyndon Johnson . There 's something about your party that limits them to smaller landslides. @!MATTHEW-DOWD-@1-AB# @(Off-camera) Let 's get - well , I 'll give you another historical fact , just to - not just to , sort of , defend the Obama administration on this . Only one Democrat who sought re-election as president of the United States has lost in the last 100-something-plus years , Jimmy Carter , because it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a incumbent president , it seems very difficult to beat a Democrat incumbent president , especially in an environment where people want some sort of economic populism , where , if the Republicans have a nominee that does n't seem to represent that , it 's a more difficult process . @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) As long as things are moving in the right direction on the economy , that 's the point that David Axelrod is actually banking on , that even if the absolute numbers - and you pointed all of them out - are pretty dismal on unemployment , as long as the trend is moving in the right direction , that will help him . @!GEORGE-WILL-@1-ABC# @(Off-camera) Yeah , Ronald Reagan - under Ronald Reagan , unemployment went to 10.8% . He carried 49 states in 1984 because it was down to 7.4% . Now , take the unemployment rate today . If it improves one-tenth of 1% - one-tenth of 1% between now and September , it will be at 7.6% and in the right direction . And you could have Obama in very good shape . @!DONNA-BRAZILE-@1-A# @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suburban Philadelphia , saying that , you know , as CEO of Bain Capital , you know , I fired people , I closed down factories , and I shipped jobs overseas . I mean , President Obama ... @!JAKE-TAPPER-@1-ABC# @(Off-camera) I do n't think he 's actually going to say that . @!MARY-MATALIN-@1REP# Yeah . @!JAKE-TAPPER-@1-ABC# @(Off-camera) I 'm just saying . I mean ... @!MARY-MATALIN-@1REP# Trying to get on the campaign . @!DONNA-BRAZILE-@1-A# @(Off-camera) Putting words in his mouth ... @!JAKE-TAPPER-@1-ABC# @(Off-camera) I 'm pretty sure that 's not ... @!DONNA-BRAZILE-@1-A# @(Off-camera) I 'm trying to put words in his mouth . But , look , I think President Obama 's biggest challenge , of course , is to get voting enthusiasm up on the Democratic side . I mean , he ca n't bank on 53% of the people coming back out . You 've got to work that . You 've got to go out there and convince people that he 's been able to turn things around , he 's making progress , you know , despite all of the opposition . And also , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So while the 2004 numbers - and George Bush is an interesting comparison - I do n't think this is 2004. @!MATTHEW-DOWD-@1-AB# @(Off-camera) One thing before we - I think that - we all think and the Obama administration think it 's gon na be Mitt Romney . But I think Mitt Romney 's gon na face , as these processes go - every single person in a campaign faces - they have to - they get - they lose somewhere and they have to recover from that loss in order to get the nomination . I think Mitt Romney is still ... @!MARY-MATALIN-@1REP# We need to get a grip . As you just opined , this is the playoff . Bachmann is Detroit , I 'm sorry to have to say , okay ? Huntsman 's going to effectively eliminate himself , although ... @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) You think he gets out ? @!MARY-MATALIN-@1REP# His campaign said this morning they 're staying in it for the - I do n't - I do n't know where he goes . But we have a ways to go . And to the point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them are trying to say in different ways , it 's more than " This is the economy , stupid " , it is cultural . The Tea Party - the essence of the Tea Party is that we are at a tipping point . There 's a cultural degradation that is tied to an expanding government that 's limiting our liberties . So it 's more than just whatever is the economic number , unemployment number ... @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) And on those cultural issues , you know , Mitt Romney had some fun at my expense last night . But what role will they play , the issues of gay marriage , abortion ? Because clearly , Democrats want to paint whoever gets the nomination as an extremist on this . @!MARY-MATALIN-@1REP# I do n't mean - that 's what tends to be the conventional wisdom of what the social issues are , but it 's bigger than that . It 's the number of people on food stamps , it 's the way in which our education system , which we have the last per people expenditure in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Our poverty programs are impoverishing families . It 's all those kinds of issues that stem from social welfare policies . I 'm not talking about ... @!DONNA-BRAZILE-@1-A# @(Off-camera) It stems from a recession that people are still feeling , that they 're trying to dig out . @!MARY-MATALIN-@1REP# Well , we 're talking about 40 years of these programs , Donna , and they 're not working . And they 're not just wasteful but counterproductive , when 40% of kids are now born out of wedlock versus 40 years ago , when these poverty programs were put in place . It 's just bigger . It 's not about gay rights and abortion . @!JAKE-TAPPER-@1-ABC# @(Off-camera) Right . And I think what Mary is touching on , which I have heard from Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum on the trail , and Rick Perry as well , is the idea that this needs to be - the candidate needs to be , the Republican nominee , a bold difference from Barack Obama . And that 's their selling point . That 's what Rick Santorum - he did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't think , but I have heard him on the stump do it - this needs to be a candidate of bold colors , not pale pastels . @!MATTHEW-DOWD-@1-AB# @(Off-camera) The problem is their - one of the problems with that argument , which is what they 're facing , is their biography does n't match up with that - with that language , because they 're creatures of Washington at a time when voters do n't want a creature of Washington . @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) Mike Huckabee could have - could have delivered that argument . @!MATTHEW-DOWD-@1-AB# @(Off-camera) And that 's why so many people gave props to Rick Perry before he entered and before he stumbled this , which is why his candidacy was a highlight of many people before he stumbled . @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) Let me talk about one of the other X factors here , Ron Paul , on the stage last night , did pretty well in Iowa , has a strong following here , did not fully rule out , although it does n't look like he 's going to run a third-party candidate , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to put a third-party candidate on the ticket . What impact does that have ? In past elections , 1968 , 1992 , the third-party candidate tends to hurt the incumbent . @!GEORGE-WILL-@1-ABC# @(Off-camera) Absolutely . It gets people who are dissatisfied with the status quo . So they will be taking 70 , 80% away of potential Republican votes against Obama . But , the successful third-party candidates have a regional base , a vivid personality and a burning issue - George Wallace for example , Eugene Debs when he was a socialist . @!JAKE-TAPPER-@1-ABC# @(Off-camera) Define successful . They did n't win . @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) Got a lot of votes though . @!GEORGE-WILL-@1-ABC# @(Off-camera) That 's the point . Under the winner take all allocation of electoral votes , you can win 19% of the popular vote as Perot did , get nothing . But you make your point . We have had candidates who said , vote for me I 'll send a message . And some people want to send a message not a president . @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) Do you see it this time around , Donna @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same-day registration , let 's see if they go out like they did in Iowa and vote for Ron Paul . Ron Paul has energy . He has enthusiasm . You go to his rallies , you come away with not just a bumper sticker and a button , but you come away with a drive and passion that you want to go out there and really work hard for this guy . @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) Mary , how do the Democrats handle him ? @!MARY-MATALIN-@1REP# I make just a point on this third-party where he - where Paul is going to hurt Obama , he who is enthusiastic , are young people . The drop off vote for Obama has been greatest among young people who were not just voters , they got their parents to vote . They got everybody excited . That 's who is - that 's how - what Paul is doing to Obama . So everyone thinks that this is gon na hurt the Republican Party . I do n't think it is. @!JAKE-TAPPER-@1-ABC# @(Off-camera) The big decision the Paul family is going to have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fact - and he knows he 's not going to be the nominee , but the big decision is if Ron Paul goes third party , he is going to be messing up his son Rand Paul 's political future . He is a Republican senator from Kentucky . He is ... @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) He was up here last night . @!JAKE-TAPPER-@1-ABC# @(Off-camera) He was up here last night . He 's with his dad all over the place . And he actually could be a Republican presidential nominee , unlike his father , if Ron - if dad leaves the party , he 's ruining a lot of ground work ... @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) Look , you got Mary Matalin nodding her head here . @!MARY-MATALIN-@1REP# No , because if you - he 's the best cleanup crew . If anybody 's zany in this , you know , it is n't Newt . So Rand 's following Ron around cleaning up saying " what he meant , what he meant , what he meant . " He 's been the best surrogate . And he 's very effective . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if there 's a third party in this , it 's likely to be Ron Paul . I think when answer to many of your questions last night , George , he basically said I 'm going to support the Republican nominee . @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) Yeah . @!MATTHEW-DOWD-@1-AB# @(Off-camera) He sort of - he did n't want to promise it , but he basic - it 's somebody else . But I that window for a third party only opens if Mitt Romney is n't the nominee . If it 's somebody that looks much more polarizing - Mitt Romney is going , as soon as if he can clinch the nomination , he 's gon na turn and become the Massachusetts moderate again . That 's what he 's gon na do . And I think the opening only becomes if Rick Santorum or somebody like that is polarizing , then a third party . @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) You got just a bit of time left . I want to go quickly around the table , when does this nomination fight end ? @!DONNA-BRAZILE-@1-A# @(Off-camera) March . Mid-March . @!GEORGE-WILL-@1-ABC# @(Off-camera) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $4 million a week easily campaigning in Florida . They 're already voting in Florida by absentee ballots . That will be the test of anyone 's staying power . It 's Grant against Lee . Romney is grant , Lee was dashing , glamorous , nimble , courageous , and he went to Appomattox. @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) I think we 'll know by Florida too . @!JAKE-TAPPER-@1-ABC# @(Off-camera) I 'm waiting to find out who 's Lee ? That 's the problem right now . If Rick Santorum is - I think any one of these conservative alternatives , these non-Romneys or Nomneys if you want to call them that , they - I think any one of them could actually beat Mitt Romney , but there needs to be one and he needs to be a force . And I have not met him yet . @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) Only got 10 seconds left , guys . @!MARY-MATALIN-@1REP# It 's going to go on longer . And that 's good for us. @!MATTHEW-DOWD-@1-AB# @(Off-camera) February 1st , we 'll know if the process ends that day or the process goes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Terrific roundtable. @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) When we come back , two new brand new features from our powerhouse political team . @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Voiceover) First , Jon Karl with the surprising political stories you were talking about online this week . @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Voiceover) And later , Mitt Romney and John McCain , Demi Moore and Ashton Kutcher , what do these two pairs have in common ? John Berman explains . @GRAPHICS @!ANNOUNCER-# A special " This Week " with George Stephanopoulos from Manchester , New Hampshire will continue in a moment , after this from our ABC station . COMMERCIAL BREAK ' 
##4103526 @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) Now for more on the debate and where the Republicans go from here , we go turn to the man who four years ago was surging out of Iowa . @!MIKE-HUCKABEE-@1-F# A new day is needed in American politics just like a new day is needed in American government . And tonight , it starts here in Iowa . But it does n't end here . It goes all of the way through the other states and ends at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue , one year from now . @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) A high point for Mike Huckabee four years ago . And the former candidate and Fox News contributor joins us from Little Rock , Arkansas . Now , of course , he served as governor there . And thank you so much for coming out this morning , Governor . Four years ago , right after the Iowa caucuses , right before the New Hampshire primary you were on " This Week . " It 's great to have you back again . @!MIKE-HUCKABEE-@1-F# Well , it 's nice to be back . It does n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was . So thank you for having me today , George . @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) Well , thanks coming on . Did you see anything last night to slow Mitt Romney down ? @!MIKE-HUCKABEE-@1-F# No , if last night was a NASCAR race , Mitt Romney had a couple of laps on everybody , and all he had to do was keep from hitting the wall . And I would say this , when his car came off the track last night there was no dents in it . And it was one of those kind of unexpected debates , because I think everybody thought that it was going to be a pile-up and that Mitt Romney 's car would be right in middle of it , but it appeared that everyone was a little hesitant , if not timid , in going after him directly . And I think everyone who watched the debate was surprised by that . @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) How do you explain that ? @!MIKE-HUCKABEE-@1-F# You know , I do n't explain it . It 's inexplicable to me that a person who is clearly the frontrunner who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ South Carolina , who could well be on his way to running the tables in the first several states and if that happens , it 's going to be very difficult to catch up to him , because it will create an imbalance in not only the financial contributions , but a sense of the momentum . And the media has lot to do with driving the sense of the inevitable . And whether we like that or not - believe me , I 've been on the receiving end of that and I know what that can mean . And so as a result , it was almost , just critical that the other candidates did what they could do to dent up his car a little bit and stay close to his fender . They just did n't do it . And I do n't have any explanation for that . @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) There was some - there was some critique from Newt Gingrich on Mr Romney 's tenure at Bain Capital . Forgive me if I misquote you , but I think was n't it four years ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he reminded a lot of people of the guy who fired your dad or something along those lines . And you just heard David Axelrod right here talk about Bain Capital . Is that going to be a problem for Governor Romney going forward ? @!MIKE-HUCKABEE-@1-F# Well , let me give you the quote exactly . And I never attributed it to Mitt Romney , but I think a lot of people made the attribution and went there with it . But my comment , it was on the " Jay Leno Show , " I said , you know people are looking to elect a president who reminds you of the guy you worked with , not the guy that laid you off . And , you know , I never said Mitt Romney , a lot of people thought that that 's where I was headed with it . @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) Well , it was , was n't it ? @!MIKE-HUCKABEE-@1-F# While it was an attempt to go after him for - well , I will never tell you that , George . I 'll let you make that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's the point , if Mitt Romney really wants to defend Bain Capital , the way that he should do it , is to say did some jobs get lost in the process of what we did ? Of course . But if we go to Washington , we know that there 's some downsizing that needs to be done with the bloated federal government that for the first time in our history now has a debt that 's bigger than the entire GDP of the country for the first time in our entire history . And that may require some serious budget cutting in the government . I have experienced it in the private sector . I 'm prepared to do it in the public sector . That 's the answer that I think he could give , not that I 'm trying to give him political advice , because he seems to be doing very well without me. @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) Let 's talk about Rick Santorum for a little bit . He 's trying to strike some of the same populist blue collar chords that you talked about four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw last night from Ron Paul . Take a look . @GRAPHICS @!RON-PAUL-@1REPUBLI# So , you 're a big spender . That 's all there is to it . You 're a big government conservative . And you do n't vote for , you know , right to work and these very important things . And that 's what weakens the economy . So to say you 're a conservative I think is a stretch . But you have convinced a lot of people of it , so , but somebody has to point out your record . @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) You know , talking to some campaign strategists last night , they think that Rick Santorum may have miscalculated by coming here to New Hampshire . They point to your experience saying that last time around it might have been better for you to skip New Hampshire , go straight to South Carolina , which is much more fertile ground for a conservative . Do you buy that ? @!MIKE-HUCKABEE-@1-F# No , I do n't , George . And part of the reason is because everybody political writer that 's on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hampshire right now . And if Rick Santorum had bypassed New Hampshire and gone to South Carolina , people would have said , well , he just could n't compete . @!MIKE-HUCKABEE-@1-F# Four years ago , the decision that we made to go ahead and compete in New Hampshire even though we came in the third , knowing that we probably would not do better than that , given that you had Mitt Romney and John McCain both superstars in that state , we knew that if we did n't do that , people would say , oh , well he 's a regional candidate . He can only compete in the south . Or he 's a demographic candidate , he can only compete with evangelicals . So we knew that even though it was somewhat risky , we had to show that we were prepared to campaign in every state . Rick Santorum is doing the same thing . He has to - he can not somehow be pegged as the guy who can only campaign where there are value voters who will vote for him . That would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know a lot of conservatives - a lot of conservatives concerned that now the conservative vote will be split . Newt Gingrich going to South Carolina , Rick Perry going to South Carolina , Rick Santorum going to South Carolina , do you think that there will be some kind of closing of ranks before South Carolina or is this the field ? @!MIKE-HUCKABEE-@1-F# I don think there will be , because you have people heavily invested in each of these candidates . You 've got a lot of people who have given a lot of money to Rick Perry . I think that 's one of the reasons he 's still in this thing . You 've got people who are very excited about Rick Santorum . You got people who are very committed to Newt Gingrich. @!MIKE-HUCKABEE-@1-F# You know , who gets to say , all right , I 'm the king , the other guys are princes . Nobody 's going to work this hard to get this far and suddenly just exit the stage because someone suggested they ought to . In fact , four years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , why do n't you get out of the way ? Why do n't you quit ? Why do n't you just leave , you ca n't win ? That just made me more determined . That makes you mad when you 've put your life on the line . @!MIKE-HUCKABEE-@1-F# And so , no , there 's not going to be some magic moment at which three , or four of these people sit around a campfire toasting marshmallows , singing Kumbaya and giving the nod to one of their competitors . That just is n't gon na happen . And anybody who thinks it is has never run for public office . @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) How long does this fight go ? @!MIKE-HUCKABEE-@1-F# I think depending on whether Romney wins New Hampshire and South Carolina , if he should win those two , go to Florida and win there , there may be some folks who limp along for a while since the delegate process will go well into the first part of March . I do n't see how they catch up with him if he runs the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see all this , any regrets at all you did n't get into the race this time around ? @!MIKE-HUCKABEE-@1-F# None whatsoever . I mean , I watch this with - and sometimes I watch it and I say , oh , my . Here 's what I would have said on that stage . But , you know , you do n't regret decisions that in your heart that you believe were right . If you start regretting those decisions , you made the wrong one . @!MIKE-HUCKABEE-@1-F# And I think one of the reasons that I have complete peace about the decision that I made was that it was made not from what would have been a good political moment , because I think I might have had one , but it was a deeply personal one and , you know , I 'm at peace with it . @!MIKE-HUCKABEE-@1-F# And I think we 've got good candidates . I disagree with people who say , oh , it 's the weakest field we 've ever had . Every four years that 's what people say . And then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think the biggest issue is that the Democrats have to worry about a weak field . They 've only got one candidate and he does n't have that great a record to run on . @!MIKE-HUCKABEE-@1-F# And with all due respect to David Axelrod , you know , who 's trying to tell us what a great job he 's doing , there are a lot of Americans who do n't have jobs . There are a lot of people who , when they go to the gas pump and squeeze , they can barely put five bucks in the tank because prices are much higher than they ought to be in this country . So , I think any Republican who gets the nomination is going to be in a very good position to take the game to a president who has n't exactly had a stellar performance because he was not ready for this incredible job that he has inherited . @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) And , and it is likely to be a tight race . Governor Huckabee , thanks very much for coming on this morning . @!MIKE-HUCKABEE-@1-F# @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @(Off-camera) Take care . @!**29;62;TOOLONG @(Voiceover) And when we come back , a lot of analysis on this week 's powerhouse " Roundtable , " George Will , Jake Tapper , Donna Brazile , Matthew Dowd , and Mary Matalin. @GRAPHICS @!ANNOUNCER-# " This Week " with George Stephanopoulos brought to you by ... COMMERCIAL BREAK ' 
##4103527 @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) And with that , let me bring in the President 's top strategist , David Axelrod , great to have you here in New Hampshire this morning . @!DAVID-AXELROD-@1-O# George , welcome back . @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) It is good to be back . Boy , you saw right of the box , Mitt Romney last night walking that tightrope on the economy , welcoming the good news , but saying President Obama does n't deserve any credit for it . He 's made things worse . That 's going to be the key debate of this campaign . @!DAVID-AXELROD-@1-O# He ought to ask 1.5 million auto workers and people who work in the auto industry who are working today because the President intervened when Mitt Romney said we should let Detroit go bankrupt . He said something worse than that , George . And more preposterous , which is that the President 's policies have made the recession worse . The fact is ... @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) That 's his argument . @!DAVID-AXELROD-@1-O# Well , the facts - he has a lot of arguments , none of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the history of this , the President came to office , the quarter before he got to office , the country , the economy shrunk by 9% . The first month he was there , the country lost 750,000 jobs . We 've had 22 months of private-sector job growth now . It 's been a climb up . And there are a series of - manufacturing up for the first time in decades . @!DAVID-AXELROD-@1-O# I mean , we have plenty of work to do . We have got big problems that took a long time in the making , they 're going to take some time - more time than we 'd like to solve . But to say that his policies made the recession worse - and here 's the thing , George - he had - when he was running in president in 2007 , in 2008 , he had not one unkind word , one critique of the economic policies of the last administration that led up to and through the worst of this recession . He thinks that the policies that were in place then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go back to them . @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) But unemployment is still not as low as you all predicted it would be when President Obama first came in , and according to most projections , it 's likely to be the highest for any incumbent president in modern times . @!DAVID-AXELROD-@1-O# Well , we 'll see where those statistics lay . I think the direction is important here . Governor Romney may be rooting for slips and falls here . We are concentrating on moving this economy forward . But there 's a larger issue , George , which is what kind of economy are we aiming for ? We have to get people back to work , but we also have to make sure that work pays . @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) You know , governor ... @!DAVID-AXELROD-@1-O# And that 's a big distinction between us and Governor Romney . He does n't understand that that is a fundamental issue that is facing this country . @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) He also started to take some fire last night on his tenure at Bain Capital . And something you , Democrats , the Democratic National @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ campaign so far . He 's not backing down at all . And you saw him last night , Governor Romney saying his team at Bain Capital is responsible for creating 100,000 jobs . Do you have any quarrel with that number ? @!DAVID-AXELROD-@1-O# Absolutely . Not me , forget about me - every independent fact checker who 's looked at it , including the Associated Press last night , after the debate , said he ca n't back up that number , and his campaign has conceded that they can't. @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) He says that the net-net number ... @!DAVID-AXELROD-@1-O# No , I know he said it 's a net-net number , and he said I 'm a numbers guy . The problem is that neither he nor his campaign can furnish any evidence to support that . But let 's talk about Bain and let 's talk about what it was and what he did . His partner said in " The LA Times , " our job was not to create jobs , our job was to create wealth for our partners . And here 's what they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stores and offices . They outsourced tens of thousands of jobs , and they took 12 companies to bankruptcy . And on those bankruptcies , he and his partners made hundreds of millions of dollars . He says this is the real economy . This is the model for the country . I do n't think those are the values that people want to animate our economy . He is not a job creator , he is a corporate raider . Those are n't the values that we want to lead our economy . @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) It 's clear you think that 's gon na be a vulnerability for Governor Romney . But coming out of Iowa , coming out of the debate last night , going into this primary here in New Hampshire , are you more convinced than ever that he 's gon na be the nominee ? @!DAVID-AXELROD-@1-O# Well , I do n't know what the answer is to that . I mean , it 's clear that there are a majority of Republicans who are resistant to him . He only got a quarter of the vote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He has one of his homes here , and he was the governor of the neighboring state . So we 'll see how this process goes . But his fundamental problem is one of trust . I do n't think conservatives trust him and I do n't think moderates trust him . And you saw last night him shifting on a whole range of positions from abortion to China to taxes . @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) But he is getting the - but he is getting the support of Republicans who think he is best able to beat President Obama . Is he the strongest candidate ? @!DAVID-AXELROD-@1-O# Well we 'll see , George . I do n't think that , frankly , bringing a Bain mentality to this economy , to running this economy makes him a strong candidate . I do n't think shifting and moving around on positions , fundamental positions is one that people are going to embrace . Trust is a big issue in the presidency . I think there 's a big trust question when it comes to Governor Romney. @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) And the economy is going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last night started to take aim at President Obama on the issue of national security and defense . Coming off the announcement this week from the President and Secretary Panetta that the military is going to be downsized , no longer poised to fight two full wars . And Governor Perry was tough on that last night . @GRAPHICS @!RICK-PERRY-@1REPUB# You can not cut $1 trillion from the Department of Defense budget and expect that America 's freedoms are not going to be jeopardized . That to me is the biggest problem that America faces , is a president that does n't understand the military and a president who is allowing the reduction of the DOD budget so that he can spend money in other places , and it will put America 's freedom in jeopardy . @GRAPHICS @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) Worried they can make that soft-on-defense argument work ? @!DAVID-AXELROD-@1-O# Well , Governor Perry has had a problem with counting before . The fact is that the trillion-dollar figure he cites includes a trigger that is in place , but we expect that we 're going to deal with that trigger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's using an inflated number . The point here is , though , is less about numbers and whether we 're gon na have the kind of military that can face the challenges we face in the 21st century . Warfare has changed , the nature of our opponents have changed . High-tech warfare is much more important . We have to be agile , we have to be quick , and we need to develop that kind of military . @!DAVID-AXELROD-@1-O# But I must say , I do n't think the President needs to justify his national security bona fides to the crowd that was on that podium last night . And I think , when you look at the record - ending the war in Iraq , bringing Osama bin Laden to justice , destroying the leadership of Al Qaeda - I think Americans know that this president - and he has made some very tough calls . I know Governor Romney said , well , any president would have given the order on Osama bin Laden . Bob Gates said it was the most courageous decision he has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So I 'm not sure Mitt Romney would have made that decision . That was a very courageous decision . @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) Also this morning , a new book out about the White House by Jodi Kantor of " The New York Times " about the President and Mrs Obama . It 's called " The Obamas. " @GRAPHICS @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Voiceover) I want to read a little bit of an excerpt from Ms Kantor 's piece in " The New York Times " about it . It 's talking about the first lady and says , " New to the ways of Washington , but impassioned about what her husband had been elected to do , she saw herself as a guardian of values . She was sometimes hard on her husband 's team than he was , eventually urging him to replace them , and the tensions grew so severe that one top adviser erupted in a meeting in 2010 , cursing the absent first lady . " @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) Jodi Kantor talked to 33 people inside and around the White House . It does paint a portrait of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ East Wing and the West Wing . Is it an accurate portrayal ? @!DAVID-AXELROD-@1-O# No , it 's not . You know - you can take any one incident and exaggerate ... @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) That incident is true , though , is n't it ? @!DAVID-AXELROD-@1-O# Yeah , and the context of it is important . And we do n't have time to rehearse it here . But George , you were in a White House , you understand that that 's very - every day is a very tense working environment and you can have great collegiality and that does n't mean that people have exchanges and words . I think the First Lady and her staff worked very well when I was there with the West Wing . She 's a sensational person and highly regarded by everybody who works there . @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) The book suggested that at times she was reluctant to go out on the campaign trial . Will she be a full partner in this year 's election ? @!DAVID-AXELROD-@1-O# Well , she has been reluctant because her first priority is taking - looking after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's been out quite a bit . She 'll be out more . She believes deeply in the President and more than that she believes deeply in this country and what we need to do to create an environment in which people can work hard , get ahead , feel like their children are gon na do better . That 's what this election is all about . And so , yes , she 'll be out there . @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) David Axelrod , thanks very much . @!DAVID-AXELROD-@1-O# All right , George , good to be with you . @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) Good to be with you .

##4103528 @!CHRIS-CUOMO-@1-ABC# @(Off-camera) Good evening . If you had a daughter with a crippling condition , any parent would do anything to help her . But what if you chose a therapy that seemed to turn her against you that even landed you in jail in a face-off against the toughest enemy ever , a justice system determined to tear your family apart . And here 's another horrifying what if . What if you came to find out that the therapy that started all of this appears to be no better than playing with a Ouija board ? @!TALI-WENDROW-@1MOT# You have this family that find themselves caught up in this hellish nightmare brought on by overzealous prosecutors . There ca n't by anything worse than that . @!CHRIS-CUOMO-@1-ABC# @(Voiceover) Julian and Tali Wendrow had a simple dream of domestic tranquility in their pleasant Detroit suburb of West Bloomfield . @!TALI-WENDROW-@1MOT# It 's a pretty quiet life . Typical middle , upper middle-class community in , in the Midwest . @!JULIAN-WENDROW-@1F# This community is exactly what we were looking for . @!CHRIS-CUOMO-@1-ABC# @(Voiceover) They never imagined they could be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their home . Julian locked behind bars , faced with the possibility of spending the rest of his life in prison , with one thought pounding in his brain . @!JULIAN-WENDROW-@1F# What am I doing here ? What am I doing here ? @!DEBORAH-GORDON-@1W# It 's literally craziness . It 's going down the rabbit hole in " Alice in Wonderland . " @!CHRIS-CUOMO-@1-ABC# @(Voiceover) This is not what Julian , a native of South Africa , expected from the land of the free when he moved here about 20 years ago after meeting Tali . She worked in a county court system . He , a house painter . They had two children , Aislinn and her younger brother , Ian , and family was truly the center of their lives . @!TALI-WENDROW-@1MOT# Our primary focus was making sure that the kids were well taken care of . And if there was an issue that needed to be addressed , we would address it . @!CHRIS-CUOMO-@1-ABC# @(Voiceover) And there turned out to be plenty of issues . @!CHRIS-CUOMO-@1-ABC# @(Off-camera) They drop a bomb on you , basically . They say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @!CHRIS-CUOMO-@1-ABC# @(Voiceover) Aislinn was diagnosed with severe autism around age 2. @!CHRIS-CUOMO-@1-ABC# @(Off-camera) What do you do ? @!JULIAN-WENDROW-@1F# Well , you first cry . And Tali did a lot of that . @!CHRIS-CUOMO-@1-ABC# @(Off-camera) She 's a beautiful young lady . @!CHRIS-CUOMO-@1-ABC# @(Voiceover) But like the 10.2 million families in this country living with a special needs child , they came to realize that Aislinn was a blessing . @!JULIAN-WENDROW-@1F# I love , you know , being with her . You know , whatever I can do , I - I just , just being in her presence is just a wonderful thing . She 's a gift from God . @!CHRIS-CUOMO-@1-ABC# @(Voiceover) As the Wendrows would discover , autism is a mysterious condition , a neurological disorder that impacts every child differently . Some kids can function well , some like Aislinn are profoundly disabled . Unable to talk , Aislinn lives in her own silent world . @!CHRIS-CUOMO-@1-ABC# @(Off-camera) Frustration is that you had every reason to believe there could be so much more in there ... @!JULIAN-WENDROW-@1F# Right . @!CHRIS-CUOMO-@1-ABC# @(Off-camera) ... if we could just find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unlock ... @!JULIAN-WENDROW-@1F# Yes . @!CHRIS-CUOMO-@1-ABC# @(Off-camera) ... what 's holding her back . @GRAPHICS @GRAPHICS @!EXPOSED-# @!CHRIS-CUOMO-@1-ABC# @(Voiceover) To understand the Wendrows pain , you have to understand all they have done to help Aislinn break out . They spent years researching every treatment under the sun and trying most of them . They tried various therapies , special diets , even autism summer camps . But nothing had broken through . Aislinn would n't talk , could n't communicate . In 2004 , she 's still in a special autism class at school doing work similar to this , matching pictures , connecting dots . @!CHRIS-CUOMO-@1-ABC# @(Off-camera) You believe that ... @!JULIAN-WENDROW-@1F# Totally . @!CHRIS-CUOMO-@1-ABC# @(Off-camera) ... there was a person inside , there was someone in there , right ? @!JULIAN-WENDROW-@1F# There is someone in there , absolutely . @!TALI-WENDROW-@1MOT# Right . @!CLIP-FROM- " PRIMETI# @!CHRIS-CUOMO-@1-ABC# @(Voiceover) But then what looked like a miracle , a breakthrough autism treatment that took the country by storm . @!FATHER-@1MALE@2-# I had seen something incredible . @!CHRIS-CUOMO-@1-ABC# @(Voiceover) As ABC News had reported on " Primetime Live " in 1992 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called facilitated communication or FC . @!DIANE-SAWYER-@1-AB# @(Voiceover) Inside these autistic bodies , there was someone who had something to say . @!CHRIS-CUOMO-@1-ABC# @(Voiceover) It seemed like a revolutionary idea , that if someone holds an autistic child 's hand or arm a certain way , that child can type their own thoughts , and for the first time , every parents dream , actual communication . @!DIANE-SAWYER-@1-AB# @(Off-camera) Tell me your favorite word to spell . @!FACILITATOR-@1FEMA# Intelligent . @!CHRIS-CUOMO-@1-ABC# @(Voiceover) There are no drugs or special equipment required . Just an ordinary keyboard and a properly trained facilitator . For the first time , the Wendrows feel that maybe , just maybe , they found an answer to their prayers . @!JULIAN-WENDROW-@1F# We believed . @!TALI-WENDROW-@1MOT# Right . @!CHRIS-CUOMO-@1-ABC# @(Voiceover) That belief turns to unalloyed joy when Aislinn tries FC and suddenly seems to be able to answer questions . @!CHRIS-CUOMO-@1-ABC# @(Off-camera) Facilitated communication winds up being a breakthrough . @!TALI-WENDROW-@1MOT# We 're absolutely in tears . Initially , it was , oh , my goodness . This is , this is great . Wow , I , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @(Voiceover) So , of course , the Wendrows fight to get FC for Aislinn at school . Almost overnight , Aislinn 's days of matching pictures and connecting dots are through . Now , she 's in a regular class , doing the same work as normal students . She supposedly completes homework , does math problems , writes poetry . By the time she graduates middle school , a teacher is reporting Aislinn not only wants to go to college , she hopes to become a professor . @!TALI-WENDROW-@1MOT# All these dreams that , that we 'd had that we thought were dashed are back . And now , maybe she will go to university . Maybe she will have a real job and , and have a lot more independence in her life . @!CHRIS-CUOMO-@1-ABC# @(Voiceover) In a statement to " 20/20 , " the district says that the results were surprising . This eighth-grade evaluation of Aislinn claims she reads and comprehends at grade level . Later on , she 'd even develop opinions about President Bush and the Iraq War . The Wendrows think they 've achieved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the word about the wonders of FC . But what the family does n't know is that from the purest desire to help their daughter , the stage is now set for a tragedy that will tear them apart . Aislinn is about to send her parents to jail . @!JULIAN-WENDROW-@1F# This mess erupted because I tried so damn hard to help this child . @!CHRIS-CUOMO-@1-ABC# @(Voiceover) Stay with us. @!COMMERCIAL-BREAK-# @!CHRIS-CUOMO-@1-ABC# @(Voiceover) It was just a few keystrokes . A couple of sentences on a computer screen . On November 27th , 2007 right around Thanksgiving , the severely autistic Aislinn Wendrow is describing her weekend and types this on her computer at school , " My dad gets me up . He puts his hands on my private parts . " The Wendrows lives would never be the same . @!JULIAN-WENDROW-@1F# There was a message on the answering machine , and I listened to it . He said there 's been this allegation . It 's indescribable . Wham . @!CHRIS-CUOMO-@1-ABC# @(Voiceover) Before this , the Wendrows were convinced Aislinn had achieved a kind of miracle using a therapy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trained person using a special grip supposedly helps Aislinn move her hand to the letters so she can type out her thoughts . But that was before she entered high school and got a new facilitator named Cindy Scarsella. @!DEBORAH-GORDON-@1W# Of all the people who had ever done facilitated communication with Aislinn , she knew the least about it . She sat through one hour she said of unpaid training . @!CHRIS-CUOMO-@1-ABC# @(Off-camera) One hour . @!DEBORAH-GORDON-@1W# One hour . @!CHRIS-CUOMO-@1-ABC# @(Voiceover) That was enough for Scarsella to facilitate those sex allegations and everything to follow . @!LORI-BRASIER-@1 " DE# The allegations were just horrific , the , the kind of story you 'd , you know , would keep you up at night . @!CHRIS-CUOMO-@1-ABC# @(Voiceover) Lori Brasier of the " Detroit Free Press " covered the story from the very start . She says the school reported the allegations , and the prosecutor 's office sprang into action . She says that was their reputation with sex cases . @!LORI-BRASIER-@1 " DE# There was the sense that they 'd never met a child who had n't been molested . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . @!CHRIS-CUOMO-@1-ABC# @(Off-camera) Did they have forensics ? @!TALI-WENDROW-@1MOT# No. @!CHRIS-CUOMO-@1-ABC# @(Off-camera) Did they have statements from any other adults ? @!TALI-WENDROW-@1MOT# No. @!CHRIS-CUOMO-@1-ABC# @(Off-camera) They have anything they found in the house ? @!TALI-WENDROW-@1MOT# They had nothing . They had nothing . @!CHRIS-CUOMO-@1-ABC# @(Off-camera) What was the case based on ? @!TALI-WENDROW-@1MOT# The case was based on Aislinn 's allegations , supposed allegations . @!CHRIS-CUOMO-@1-ABC# @(Off-camera) Aislinn , the autistic child who ca n't speak . @!JULIAN-WENDROW-@1F# Right . @!TALI-WENDROW-@1MOT# Right . @!CHRIS-CUOMO-@1-ABC# @(Voiceover) Now , it 's just two days after Aislinn made those somewhat vague allegations at school . She enters this room at a special county agency where investigators hope she 'll provide more details . They 're watching what goes on from behind a glass . @!INVESTIGATOR-@1FEM# Well , my name is Amy . And my job is to talk with kids about things that have happened . @!CHRIS-CUOMO-@1-ABC# @(Voiceover) A forensic interviewer is on the right of the screen . On the left is the facilitator , Cindy Scarsella. @!INVESTIGATOR-@1FEM# I want you to tell me everything that happened last weekend . @!CHRIS-CUOMO-@1-ABC# @(Voiceover) The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advised investigators to bring in another facilitator who knew nothing about what Aislinn was claiming . But that does n't happen . @!INVESTIGATOR-@1FEM# His penis is in you and he 's kissing you ? @!CHRIS-CUOMO-@1-ABC# @(Voiceover) And now with her help , Aislinn 's allegations are mushrooming . The story is becoming more sensational . They type that sexual abuse went on since Aislinn was 6 and that Tali did nothing , that Julian has taken photos , even forced her younger brother , Ian , to take part . @!INVESTIGATOR-@1FEM# Okay . So your dad makes your brother touch him and you in your private parts . @!CHRIS-CUOMO-@1-ABC# @(Voiceover) The accusations are shocking if they are Aislinn 's words , and investigators believe they are . They accept FC in large part because they say Julian and Tali did . But the Wendrows realize now they 've been deceiving themselves all along . @!TALI-WENDROW-@1MOT# And we had to swallow a pretty bitter pill . It became pretty clear that this was , that we were wrong . @!CHRIS-CUOMO-@1-ABC# @(Off-camera) They believed in FC more than anybody else . @!DEBORAH-GORDON-@1W# So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , you know , if they think it 's gon na help the child . They 're the parent . It 's the police 's job to figure out whether she 's reliable and whether a crime has been committed . @!CHRIS-CUOMO-@1-ABC# @(Off-camera) The authorities often get criticized because they do n't follow up on allegations . Here , they did the opposite . @!DEBORAH-GORDON-@1W# Mm-hmm . @!CHRIS-CUOMO-@1-ABC# @(Voiceover) They went after it . They were aggressive , thorough . @!DEBORAH-GORDON-@1W# If they were thorough , I would n't be sitting here talking to you . This was , I have a charge , this guy is guilty . We 're gon na set about trying to hang him . Do n't bother us with facts . @!CHRIS-CUOMO-@1-ABC# @(Voiceover) And Gordon says alarms should have been going off during that very same interview . Listen to these incredible mistakes . @!INVESTIGATOR-@1FEM# What 's grandma 's name ? Her name is Julie ? @!CHRIS-CUOMO-@1-ABC# @(Voiceover) Aislinn and Scarsella type out her grandma 's name is Julie . It is Betty . They say Aislinn 's dog 's name is Henry . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it became more ridiculous . Just , I mean , crazy things that , to them , was meaningless because they had a really good story here , and they were running with it . @!CHRIS-CUOMO-@1-ABC# @(Voiceover) Not only running with the story , running to try and back it up . It does n't go well . The police search the Wendrows home and computers for those naked pictures . They find none . They take Aislinn for a medical exam . The nurse reports she observes no acute injuries . @!TALI-WENDROW-@1MOT# It made absolutely no sense , and I truly thought this was just a horrible misunderstanding and it 's gon na , it 's gon na be fixed . @!CHRIS-CUOMO-@1-ABC# @(Voiceover) Tali was confident because after so many years of trying to help Aislinn , there is one clear contradiction at the heart of these allegations . @!TALI-WENDROW-@1MOT# If you 've got a kid who ca n't talk and you are abusing that child , you do n't fight so hard to make that kid talk . @!CHRIS-CUOMO-@1-ABC# @(Voiceover) And other people are already questioning the heart of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all . Brasier says as soon as her first story on the Wendrows ran , she got a call from one of Aislinn 's former teachers . @!LORI-BRASIER-@1 " DE# And she said , " There 's no way that this child 's able to type . " And I , and I - said , " That 's not what the police are saying or the prosecutors . " And she said , " If you said to Aislinn , ' Point to the sky , the child would not be able to do that . " @!CHRIS-CUOMO-@1-ABC# @(Off-camera) I 'm gon na write an A. I 'll write a B. @!CHRIS-CUOMO-@1-ABC# @(Voiceover) When I met with Aislinn , there was no facilitated communication . So unlike the investigators , I got to see how Aislinn would respond without someone helping . @!CHRIS-CUOMO-@1-ABC# @(Off-camera) Which is the B ? Aislinn , point to the B for me . That 's an A. @!CHRIS-CUOMO-@1-ABC# @(Voiceover) The obvious question , if she ca n't identify letters , how can she spell ? And if she ca n't spell , how could she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ B. That 's right . @!DEBORAH-GORDON-@1W# The next , the only conclusion is , well , then she never could have said anything through FC . She could n't have typed . @!CHRIS-CUOMO-@1-ABC# @(Voiceover) It all leads to one disturbing conclusion , a conclusion scientists have been reaching for years . Facilitated communication is fake . Long before this case , studies had found repeatedly kids were n't actually revealing inner thoughts using FC . The facilitators were typing for them , leading the child 's hand like a psychic over a Ouija board . But wait a minute . If Aislinn was n't typing those allegations , it meant Scarsella was . How and why would she do that ? But first , things take a much darker turn . @!JOSEPH-BRUSSEAU-@1# Bullshit , man . You know what 's going on because you experienced it firsthand . @!CHRIS-CUOMO-@1-ABC# @(Voiceover) Aislinn 's 13-year-old brother , Ian , is about to be dragged into the investigation in a police interview you have to see to believe . Stay with us. @!COMMERCIAL-BREAK-# @!CHRIS-CUOMO-@1-ABC# @(Voiceover) To see Ian Wendrow with his sister , Aislinn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He 's as close to her as any brother could be . @!IAN-WENDROW-@1BROT# She 's adorable , and she 's the best .

She 's the best sister I could ever have . @!CHRIS-CUOMO-@1-ABC# @(Off-camera) What 's the bond like between the two of you ? @!IAN-WENDROW-@1BROT# It 's very strong . @!CHRIS-CUOMO-@1-ABC# @(Voiceover) So strong , in fact , that when Ian turned 13 , he turned his bar mitzvah into a joint ceremony in a synagogue filled with warmth . @!IAN-WENDROW-@1BROT# That was probably one of the best days of my life , to be honest , because there was just so much positivity that was involved in that . @!CHRIS-CUOMO-@1-ABC# @(Voiceover) But two months later , its all negative . Aislinn has typed those outrageous allegations via facilitated communication . And just hours later , Aislinn and Ian are ripped from their home by state child protection agents as part of a safety plan . @!TALI-WENDROW-@1MOT# I thought I was feeling what I would feel if they actually had died . I - I felt that depth of loss . And I did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . @!JULIAN-WENDROW-@1F# I looked at her through the window and watched her , you know , just , like drive away , and I thought , " Hopefully , this is gon na be over soon . " @!CHRIS-CUOMO-@1-ABC# @(Voiceover) Not by a long shot . The machinery of the criminal investigation is already in high gear . And after that all-important forensic interview with Aislinn and her facilitator Cindy Scarsella ... @!INVESTIGATOR-@1FEM# So your dad makes your brother touch him and you in your private parts . @!CHRIS-CUOMO-@1-ABC# @(Voiceover) Police now believe Ian is a witness and a fellow victim of Julian 's abuse . @!JOSEPH-BRUSSEAU-@1# Has there been something going on in your house ? @!IAN-WENDROW-@1BROT# No. @!CHRIS-CUOMO-@1-ABC# @(Voiceover) It 's perhaps the most troubling image of the entire case . Ian is brought to an interview room at the West Bloomfield Police Headquarters , a small boy talking to a seasoned police detective named Joseph Brusseau , who 's not always visible in this video . @!IAN-WENDROW-@1BROT# I do n't know anything . @!JOSEPH-BRUSSEAU-@1# You do n't know anything at all ? @!IAN-WENDROW-@1BROT# No. @!CHRIS-CUOMO-@1-ABC# @(Voiceover) For more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , accusations and a kind of psychological warfare by Detective Brusseau. @!DEBORAH-GORDON-@1W# This is a 13-year-old child . He had no adult there looking out for his interest whatsoever . @!JOSEPH-BRUSSEAU-@1# It 's obvious . You know what has happened between your dad and your sister . There 's no doubt about it . And we agreed that we were only gon na talk about things that were true today , right ? @!IAN-WENDROW-@1BROT# I know , but I ... @!CHRIS-CUOMO-@1-ABC# @(Voiceover) Brusseau tells Ian the interview is all about the truth . But then proceeds to lie to him . @!JOSEPH-BRUSSEAU-@1# There has been some more evidence that has come forward , which clearly indicates that there 's definitely something been going on in the house and you are part of it . @!CHRIS-CUOMO-@1-ABC# @(Voiceover) He tells the boy a call has just come in , saying the police have concrete evidence that goes beyond Aislinn 's statements . @!IAN-WENDROW-@1BROT# What exactly did you find , or is that not something you can tell me ? @!JOSEPH-BRUSSEAU-@1# Yeah , that 's part of the investigation that ca n't be revealed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 'm not gon na lie to you . If I could tell you , I would , but I can't. @!CHRIS-CUOMO-@1-ABC# @(Voiceover) Not true . The police have already searched the Wendrow home and found nothing . But despite the interrogator 's mind games , little Ian remains resolute , insisting he 's never seen his father abuse Aislinn. @!IAN-WENDROW-@1BROT# No , no. @!JOSEPH-BRUSSEAU-@1# Never ? @!IAN-WENDROW-@1BROT# No. @!JOSEPH-BRUSSEAU-@1# Okay . @!IAN-WENDROW-@1BROT# It 's never happened with me. @!JOSEPH-BRUSSEAU-@1# Are you not ready to talk about it yet ? @!IAN-WENDROW-@1BROT# No , I , everything I 've told you is everything I know up to the point of everything you 've told me , so I do n't know anything else . @!CHRIS-CUOMO-@1-ABC# @(Voiceover) The pressure starts to break the young boy down . He 's scared , exasperated , even brought to tears . @!JOSEPH-BRUSSEAU-@1# You 're lying to me. @!CHRIS-CUOMO-@1-ABC# @(Voiceover) When Brusseau still has n't gotten the answers he 's looking for , he turns hostile . @!JOSEPH-BRUSSEAU-@1# You 're not a good liar , buddy . You 're not a good liar . @!IAN-WENDROW-@1BROT# I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I , I 'm not trying to lie is what I 'm saying . @!JOSEPH-BRUSSEAU-@1# Ian , look at me . Start by telling me the truth . @!IAN-WENDROW-@1BROT# I have been telling you the truth . @!JOSEPH-BRUSSEAU-@1# I think you 've been telling me some of the truth , but I do n't think you 're being 100% honest with me . Okay ? I 'm not a dummy . You 're gon na tell me that you have never ever seen any type of sexual contact between your dad and your sister . @!IAN-WENDROW-@1BROT# No. @!CHRIS-CUOMO-@1-ABC# @(Voiceover) Frazzled by the intense badgering , Ian offers all he can think of , that his father has showered with Aislinn because she ca n't do it herself . @!IAN-WENDROW-@1BROT# Does him showering her count ? I do n't know . @!JOSEPH-BRUSSEAU-@1# Has he ever explained to you why he has to do that ? @!IAN-WENDROW-@1BROT# He does n't have to . I knew why . She had autism . She needed help showering . @!CHRIS-CUOMO-@1-ABC# @(Voiceover) Brusseau 's report on this interview goes into detail about the showering as well as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flashed him , but says little about Ian 's denials of witnessing abuse , and nothing at all about Brusseau 's own lies to the boy . The emotional damage done by the interrogation is immediate and obvious . Ian is shattered . He has stood by his father , but Detective Brusseau has corrupted their relationship . @!IAN-WENDROW-@1BROT# I 've lost the image I 've had of my dad , the image of a trustworthy person . @!CHRIS-CUOMO-@1-ABC# @(Voiceover) Brusseau may be good at asking questions to frightened teens , but when we suggested he answer my questions , he refused . In sworn testimony , he said what he did was acceptable . He calls the lies tactics necessary to get Ian to reveal all he knew . @!JULIAN-WENDROW-@1F# It really came home to me how malicious and vindictive these people are and how aggressively they wanted to get us. @!CHRIS-CUOMO-@1-ABC# @(Voiceover) As the noose tightens around Julian and Tali , the kids get shuffled from home to home . Aislinn winds up in downtown Detroit , Ian in Pontiac , at this juvenile home . @!IAN-WENDROW-@1BROT# It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moved in with kids who were like at the time 17 and 18 , whatever , much older than me who had actually been abused , you know ? And these are , these are weird kids . It was scary . @!CHRIS-CUOMO-@1-ABC# @(Voiceover) The ordeal is punctuated by heart wrenching moments like this . Ian tries to call his mom , but she is under strict orders not to have any contact with him whatsoever . @!IAN-WENDROW-@1BROT# And for a brief moment , she asked , you know , " Hello ? " I said , " Mom . " And then she hung up . @!TALI-WENDROW-@1MOT# And I heard him say , " Mom ? " And I hung up because I was so afraid that if they somehow found out that I had contact with him , that it would be over . Then I just sobbed . @!IAN-WENDROW-@1BROT# It was incredibly sad . I was like depressed the entire day . @!CHRIS-CUOMO-@1-ABC# @(Voiceover) Then , the hammer drops . On December 5th , eight days after those fateful keystrokes were first typed , Julian is home alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @!JULIAN-WENDROW-@1F# So they cuff me in the front , they put me in the police car . He , oh , he told me , " I 'm - we 're gon na take you to - to the court . You 're gon na be arraigned , and you 'll be back home within an hour or two . " That 's not what happened . @!CHRIS-CUOMO-@1-ABC# @(Voiceover) Instead , Julian is held here , in solitary , a six-by-six foot cell . @!JULIAN-WENDROW-@1F# All I knew was the counts they charged me with , mandatory , 75 years in prison . Life , that 's life to me . I would never have the opportunity to hold my children again . @!CHRIS-CUOMO-@1-ABC# @(Voiceover) Tali is also arrested but makes bail and is allowed to remain home wearing an ankle bracelet tracking device . Neither of them knows anything about Aislinn . How often were you tormented that , " I do n't know where she is . I do n't know who has her . I do n't know how to take good care of her . " @!TALI-WENDROW-@1MOT# @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be the worst part . @!TALI-WENDROW-@1MOT# Yeah , absolutely . I mean , having no idea who was tucking her in at night , who was , you know , hugging her , all of that . @!CHRIS-CUOMO-@1-ABC# @(Voiceover) With the whole family 's future hanging by a thread , the case is building toward a moment of truth ... @!LAWYER-@1FEMALE@2-# Aislinn , am I a boy or a girl ? @!CHRIS-CUOMO-@1-ABC# @(Voiceover) ... and an answer to this question , why would facilitators put words in the mouths of kids like Aislinn ? @!DEBORAH-GORDON-@1W# This is not the first time this has happened . @!CHRIS-CUOMO-@1-ABC# @(Off-camera) Other facilitators have made accusations like that ? @!DEBORAH-GORDON-@1W# Absolutely . @!CHRIS-CUOMO-@1-ABC# @(Voiceover) Stay with us. @!COMMERCIAL-BREAK-# @!JULIAN-WENDROW-@1F# My stomach is turning . I 'm sick . I 'm sick standing here . @!CHRIS-CUOMO-@1-ABC# @(Voiceover) This is the first time Julian Wendrow has returned to the Oakland County Jail building since he was locked inside here for 80 days , almost all of them in solitary confinement . @!JULIAN-WENDROW-@1F# This in here is inhumane . Lying on a concrete floor , lights on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It 's sickening . @!CHRIS-CUOMO-@1-ABC# @(Voiceover) The man responsible for Julian 's jailing was this man , Oakland county prosecutor David Gorcyca . He claims he was just prosecuting a legitimate charge that Julian was abusing his autistic daughter , Aislinn. @!DAVID-GORSYCA-@1FO# I had an opinion that , sort of , there was abuse in the house . @!CHRIS-CUOMO-@1-ABC# @(Voiceover) He gave this opinion in a sworn deposition. @!DAVID-GORSYCA-@1FO# You try to assess every witness credibility , but that issue is left for the trier of fact . Ultimately , it 's for the jury to decide who to believe . @!OFFICIAL-@1FEMALE@# Okay . @!CHRIS-CUOMO-@1-ABC# @(Voiceover) Despite the questions about the legitimacy of facilitated communication , Gorcyca finds it hard to believe that Aislinn 's facilitator , Cindy Scarsella , was just making up those accusations . @!DAVID-GORSYCA-@1FO# To me , you know , if someone is just holding an elbow or a wrist , I mean , and they 're leading , I mean , that means they 're lying for the person , I mean , that seems to me a little farfetched . @!CHRIS-CUOMO-@1-ABC# @(Voiceover) It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , why would Scarsella type what she did ? @!CHRIS-CUOMO-@1-ABC# @(Off-camera) Why would she ever do that ? @!DEBORAH-GORDON-@1W# I ca n't tell you what 's going on in the brain , but I can tell you that that , this is not the first time this has happened . @!CHRIS-CUOMO-@1-ABC# @(Off-camera) Other facilitators have made open-ended accusations like that ? @!DEBORAH-GORDON-@1W# Absolutely . @!HUGH-DOWNS-@1-ABC-# @(Voiceover) Jim and Suzette Wheaton were shocked when they heard about the charges . @!CHRIS-CUOMO-@1-ABC# @(Voiceover) Believe it or not , it 's true . Way back in 1994 , Hugh Downs reported on one such case in Maine for " 20/20. " @!HUGH-DOWNS-@1-ABC-# @(Voiceover) Betsy had claimed , through facilitated communication , that she was being abused . @!CHRIS-CUOMO-@1-ABC# @(Voiceover) Just like the Wendrow case , a facilitator came up with sex allegations against stunned parents . @!DOCTOR-HOWARD-SHAN# Can you put Gumby in the truck ? @!CHRIS-CUOMO-@1-ABC# @(Voiceover) That 's when this stepped in , Howard Shane . He runs a communication center for autistic kids at Children 's Hospital Boston . Back then , Shane came up with a test , showing one set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the child . When he asked what they saw , every single time , the answer was whatever picture he had shown the facilitator. @!DOCTOR-HOWARD-SHAN# I do n't think it 's conscious . @!CHRIS-CUOMO-@1-ABC# @(Voiceover) Shane studied what was going on and concluded the facilitator 's behavior was n't malicious . Instead , it was a bizarre psychological phenomenon he called the savior effect . The facilitators wan na help so much they do n't realize they 're making up what they type . @!DOCTOR-HOWARD-SHAN# If you think you 're really gon na help someone , that alone drives you to put reality aside . @!CHRIS-CUOMO-@1-ABC# @(Voiceover) The charges were dropped in Maine , just as they were in many other courtrooms where the same thing happened . @!DOCTOR-HOWARD-SHAN# My understanding , there were , there were 30 to 40 cases . I was personally involved in 12. @!CHRIS-CUOMO-@1-ABC# @(Voiceover) Now , in an effort to prevent another travesty of justice , Shane is hired to testify on the Wendrows behalf . @!DOCTOR-HOWARD-SHAN# You 'll see a dramatic difference in her ability when the facilitator is unaware of the information @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That 's a retained defense expert , so they 're gon na say what defense hired them to say . @!CHRIS-CUOMO-@1-ABC# @(Voiceover) ... and ready to prosecute . @!MARC-BARRON-@148TH# I 'm gon na let you ask questions of the facilitator after the facilitated communication . @!CHRIS-CUOMO-@1-ABC# @(Voiceover) But Judge Marc Barron is more skeptical about FC . He holds a special hearing to see how Aislinn answers questions her facilitator ca n't hear . Julian is there . That 's him in the orange jail jumpsuit . This is the first time he 's seen his daughter in two months . @!JULIAN-WENDROW-@1F# There 's my daughter there , she ca n't express herself . I ca n't help her . I could n't go and help my child . @!LAWYER-@1FEMALE@2-# Have you ever tried to influence purposely when she facilitates ? @!CYNTHIA-SCARSELLA-# Absolutely not . @!CHRIS-CUOMO-@1-ABC# @(Voiceover) Amazingly , despite repeated warnings to find someone new , the prosecution continues to use Cindy Scarsella. @!CYNTHIA-SCARSELLA-# And I have a finger in front of her elbow and one behind . @!MARC-BARRON-@148TH# At this point in time , we 're going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To honor the judge 's demand that Scarsella not hear the questions , the prosecution team offers to have her wear these headphones to block out the sound . But wait a minute . @!DOCTOR-HOWARD-SHAN# So these are the headphones that they were actually proposing to be used . @!CHRIS-CUOMO-@1-ABC# @(Voiceover) Howard Shane actually uses those very headphones with autistic kids in his clinic . He says they do n't block out all sound . They just block out ambient noise , which makes it easier to hear what 's being said . In court , he jumps to his feet to warn the judge . @!DOCTOR-HOWARD-SHAN# They cancel noise , nonspeech . If I had n't been there , they would have proceeded . The facilitator would 've heard the question , and it would 've looked like she was actually typing the , the answer . And I think it would 've been the end . Dad would probably be in jail today . @!CHRIS-CUOMO-@1-ABC# @(Voiceover) Thanks to Shane , the judge abandons their idea and instead , orders Scarsella to leave the courtroom entirely during the questions . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm gon na ask you a question . @!CHRIS-CUOMO-@1-ABC# @(Voiceover) Now , the moment of truth . The court will see what I saw for myself as Aislinn is asked a simple question . @!LAWYER-@1FEMALE@2-# Do you have a brother or a sister , and if you do , what is their name ? @!CHRIS-CUOMO-@1-ABC# @(Voiceover) Scarsella returns and facilitates . @!LAWYER-@1FEMALE@2-# She typed in 7BQJVWTT7YI . Can I ask Mrs. Scarsella to step out , your honor ? Can I ask another question ? @!MARC-BARRON-@148TH# Please . @!CHRIS-CUOMO-@1-ABC# @(Voiceover) Scarsella leaves again so she ca n't hear the next question . @!LAWYER-@1FEMALE@2-# Am I a girl , or am I a boy ? @!CHRIS-CUOMO-@1-ABC# @(Voiceover) Back comes Scarsella . Back comes more gibberish. @!LAWYER-@1FEMALE@2-# Okay . And her response was 6 , space , WMTI. @!JULIAN-WENDROW-@1F# Everyone was just stunned that - did he see what we just saw ? @!CHRIS-CUOMO-@1-ABC# @(Off-camera) The case seemed to fall apart . @!TALI-WENDROW-@1MOT# Yeah . @!JULIAN-WENDROW-@1F# It seemed ? It did fall apart . @!CHRIS-CUOMO-@1-ABC# @(Voiceover) Not exactly . Pay close attention to what happens next . @!LAWYER-@1FEMALE@2-# She typed in , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , F , R , I , D. @!CHRIS-CUOMO-@1-ABC# @(Voiceover) A-F-R-I-D . The prosecutors are convinced this means Aislinn is afraid of her father . @!DAVID-GORSYCA-@1FO# She says purposely tanking the questions because she did n't wan na answer questions . @!CHRIS-CUOMO-@1-ABC# @(Voiceover) Gorcyca insists Aislinn can answer the questions , but she just won't. @!DAVID-GORSYCA-@1FO# I do n't know how many occasions Aislinn was capable of answering her questions , and then we got here and everything all of a sudden did n't make sense . @!CHRIS-CUOMO-@1-ABC# @(Voiceover) Of course , all those other times , Scarsella heard the questions and could essentially put her words in Aislinn 's mouth . Shane says it 's not Aislinn who 's afraid . It 's Scarsella. @!CYNTHIA-SCARSELLA-# That is my job , and I 'm with her during her class period . @!DOCTOR-HOWARD-SHAN# When she was unable to answer , she resorted to the strategies that I had seen several times before - " I 'm - I 'm afraid , I - and did n't wan na respond . " @!CHRIS-CUOMO-@1-ABC# @(Voiceover) Shane had seen it before , and he thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But that 's not what happened . @!LORI-BRASIER-@1 " DE# This child ca n't communicate . She 's not communicating , and they still would not drop the charges . @!JULIAN-WENDROW-@1F# So what does he do after that debacle ? The whole thing crumbles , he sends me back to jail . @!LORI-BRASIER-@1 " DE# I could not eat lunch after - I could , I was just greatly dismayed to watch this go on . It was something I will never forget . @!CHRIS-CUOMO-@1-ABC# @(Off-camera) Miss Scarsella ? @!CHRIS-CUOMO-@1-ABC# @(Voiceover) When we return , the surprising end of the case . @!CHRIS-CUOMO-@1-ABC# @(Off-camera) Miss Scarsella ? I 'm Chris Cuomo from ABC News . @!CHRIS-CUOMO-@1-ABC# @(Voiceover) And we try to get some answers ... @!CHRIS-CUOMO-@1-ABC# @(Off-camera) Miss Scarsella , I do n't wan na chase you . @!CHRIS-CUOMO-@1-ABC# @(Voiceover) ... from Aislinn 's miracle worker . @!CHRIS-CUOMO-@1-ABC# @(Voiceover) I do n't wan na chase you , Miss Scarsella , but I wan na ask you about the Wendrow case . @!CHRIS-CUOMO-@1-ABC# @(Voiceover) " 20/20 " will be right back . @!COMMERCIAL-BREAK-# @!LAWYER-@1FEMALE@2-# 6H67 ... @!CHRIS-CUOMO-@1-ABC# @(Voiceover) For the Wendrows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FC is a fraud . At best , a cruel joke on desperate parents , at worst , a tool for overzealous prosecutors . And for them , it 's been both . @!TALI-WENDROW-@1MOT# It made absolutely no sense . It was n't gon na work , and it did n't work . @!CHRIS-CUOMO-@1-ABC# @(Voiceover) But the prosecutors are relentless . The case drags on for another month before they finally announce they are dropping the charges . @!CHRIS-CUOMO-@1-ABC# @(Off-camera) The prosecutor 's office ever come forward and say , " This was wrong ? " @!LORI-BRASIER-@1 " DE# No . There 's never been an acknowledgement that , " You know , we should n't have done this , or we should have had more evidence . " It 's always been , you know , some excuse . @!CHRIS-CUOMO-@1-ABC# @(Voiceover) The Wendrows are devastated by the ordeal . But after fearing they would be torn apart forever , there 's at least the comfort of being reunited . @!JULIAN-WENDROW-@1F# I was euphoric . I mean , it was just , thank God . I 've got my children back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us emotionally ? No. @!CHRIS-CUOMO-@1-ABC# @(Off-camera) How long did it take , or is it still taking , for the family to be what it was ? @!JULIAN-WENDROW-@1F# The family will never be what it was . @!TALI-WENDROW-@1MOT# The bad thing was that she was clearly traumatized by it ... @!JULIAN-WENDROW-@1F# Yeah . @!TALI-WENDROW-@1MOT# ... and we have no way of knowing ... @!JULIAN-WENDROW-@1F# Yeah . @!TALI-WENDROW-@1MOT# ... how , to what extent , and how to fix that . @!CHRIS-CUOMO-@1-ABC# @(Voiceover) For six months , Julian says Aislinn would get frantic if he was out of her sight for long . Ian , who endured that harrowing police interrogation , was deeply troubled too . @!IAN-WENDROW-@1BROT# I was mad at what they had tried to do . I wet the bed once from nightmares I had because of it . I started going to see a therapist because they had done a really good number on my head . @!CHRIS-CUOMO-@1-ABC# @(Voiceover) With the damage done to their reputations and relationships , the Wendrows filed suit against the police , the prosecutors , the school district and the state agencies involved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of alleged misconduct . @!JOSEPH-BRUSSEAU-@1# Now you realize what 's been going on in your house . @!CHRIS-CUOMO-@1-ABC# @(Voiceover) Before it ever gets to court , the police department responsible for Ian 's interview , settles , admitting no wrongdoing , but agreeing to pay $1.8 million . @!INVESTIGATOR-@1FEM# I ask all the kids I talk to not to make stuff up or pretend . @!CHRIS-CUOMO-@1-ABC# @(Voiceover) But the prosecutor 's office is defiant . Gorcyca insists he did nothing wrong . And on top of that , his office is immune from liability because it was just doing its job as mandated by law . @!CHRIS-CUOMO-@1-ABC# @(Off-camera) How can they be immune in this situation ? @!DEBORAH-GORDON-@1W# There 's a legal body of case law out there that says , as long as you 're wearing your prosecutor hat , you can say and do anything and you 're protected . @!CHRIS-CUOMO-@1-ABC# @(Off-camera) There 's no standard of reasonable behavior ? @!DEBORAH-GORDON-@1W# Yes , there is a standard . And we think they 've crossed it , and that 's what our lawsuit is all about . @!CHRIS-CUOMO-@1-ABC# @(Voiceover) But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entire investigation a runaway train , he accepted most of those immunity claims and dismissed most of Gordon 's charges . To date , the prosecutor has been able to walk between the raindrops . In this " National Law Journal " article , Gorcyca was asked if he thought the Wendrows at least deserved an apology . His response ? " Over my dead body . " @!CHRIS-CUOMO-@1-ABC# @(Off-camera) Hey , officers . How you doing ? @!POLICE-@1MALE@2-# Hi . @!CHRIS-CUOMO-@1-ABC# @(Off-camera) Chris Cuomo .

If you get him to talk to you , you get him to talk to you . @!CHRIS-CUOMO-@1-ABC# @(Voiceover) So we tried calling him from outside the building where he is now in private practice . @!CHRIS-CUOMO-@1-ABC# @(Off-camera) So you do n't wan na come outside and address this yourself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help the situation . @!CHRIS-CUOMO-@1-ABC# @(Off-camera) With all due respect , Mr. Gorcyca , we tried very hard to get you to do it the nice way .

##4103529 @!LESTER-HOLT: Welcome to DATELINE , everyone . I 'm Lester Holt . They were a young couple just starting their lives together . Like so many newlyweds , busy establishing their careers . Then , they simply vanished . They were listed as missing , no reason to suspect foul play until an eerie discovery tied to a case that made headlines on two continents and linked to the name of one of America 's most famous families . Here 's Mike Taibbi. @!MIKE-TAIBBI-report: @(Voiceover) Each step down the driveway brought her closer , a rookie detective 's first glimpse of murder . @(Tricia-Gough; -buri Detective TRICIA GOUGH : @(Voiceover) That 's just a pitiful end for a human being . @(Buried-plastic-bag @!Det-GOUGH: That 's not an acceptable end for anybody . @!TAIBBI: @(Voiceover) It all began on the afternoon of May 5th , 1994. @(San-Marino) @!Det-GOUGH: An officer had gone out on a call , and they said that they had discovered a body . @!TAIBBI: @(Voiceover) Tricia Gough was the first detective on the scene . She was told a construction crew had been digging a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet down their backhoe had snagged on some plastic bags . Inside those bags , something that shocked them . Bones . @(Police-officers; @!Det-GOUGH: A lot of the workers were standing around , and they seemed very upset by it . @!TAIBBI: @(Voiceover) She jumped down into the hole to take a closer look . @(Crime-scene-photo) @!Det-GOUGH: We saw some white material , we saw plastic , and then we saw the skull off to the side . @!TAIBBI: @(Voiceover) It was a human skeleton cut into three sections , wrapped in plastic bags and stuffed into a fiberglass box . But who 's skeleton ? And how long had it been there ? Such a ghoulish crime scene was the last thing anyone would expect in swanky San Marino . Less than 20 miles from Hollywood , its manicured lawns and mini mansions were like something out of a movie . @(Skull; @!Det-GOUGH: People have a lot of money . They 're very engaged in the community . @!TAIBBI: @(Voiceover) But , as in a thousand movie melodramas , just beneath the surface here there was something violent , something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it down , moved everybody out , taped it off , and started getting witness statements . @!TAIBBI: @(Voiceover) The detective 's first breakthrough came quickly , a tip from her sergeant . @(Gough) @!Det-GOUGH: @(Voiceover) She said , ' You know , I took a missing person report at this address a few years back . ' @(Gough; -map ) @!TAIBBI: @(Voiceover) The detective pulled the missing person 's case file . Inside she found a paper trail documenting the story of the people who 'd lived there 10 years before . In the main house there was Didi Sohus , an aging debutante , her son John , whom she doted on , and his recent bride , Linda , of whom Didi was said to be fiercely jealous . Out back , living in Didi 's guest house was a mysterious young Englishman , a recent arrival to San Marino . @(Gough; @!Det-GOUGH: It seemed to be a pretty chaotic , unhappy household . It just -- a lot of strange circumstances . @!TAIBBI: @(Voiceover) There was one other name that kept appearing in the file , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suspected something ugly had happened in that house . @(Photos-of-John-Li @!Ms-SUE-COFFMAN: There 's foul play of some kind , somewhere , somehow . @!TAIBBI: @(Voiceover) Sue Coffman met Linda in eighth grade . They 'd bonded over a schoolgirl passion for model horses . @(Photo-of-Coffman) @!Ms-COFFMAN: @(Voiceover) We would put them in halter . We would put them in saddle . We would dress them in , you know , dressage , anything . @(Horses) @!TAIBBI: @(Voiceover) After high school , Sue had watched Linda get caught up in another kind of fantasy . Linda had scored a job in Los Angeles largest science fiction bookstore. @(Photo-of-Coffman; @!Ms-COFFMAN: She was in a world that was always moving , always vibrant . @!TAIBBI: @(Voiceover) It was a world of anything goes , a world of leather-clad space vixens and intergalactic travel , a world where Linda 's size , she was fully six feet tall , did n't seem so unexpected . What did seem unexpected at the time was the man she chose to fall in love with , shy Johnny Sohus , a computer programmer with Coke-bottle glasses . @(Kaleidoscope-of-co @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her , even though she did n't reciprocate that much . @(Voiceover) But I knew she liked having him around . @(Photo-of-Linda-and @!TAIBBI: @(Voiceover) The unlikely couple married in 1983 , on Halloween , appropriately . Short on rent money , they decided to move , with their six cats , into the house owned by John 's mother . @(Wedding-photo-of-J @!Ms-COFFMAN: It looked gorgeous on the outside , nice , big , you know , nice pretty house . But when you went inside , it was just nasty in there . @!TAIBBI: @(Voiceover) Linda told her friends that John 's mother would bang on the newlywed 's bedroom door in the middle of the night . @(Photo-of-Didi; @!Ms-COFFMAN: @(Voiceover) And Linda was kind of like ... @(Photo-of-John-and- @!Ms-COFFMAN: ... ' Just stay away from her , and ' We do n't talk to her . She 's just annoying . ' @!TAIBBI: @(Voiceover) It was a dark beginning to a marriage , but even so John and Linda did seem happy . Linda had always dreamed of being an artist . And by the start of 1985 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She had had an art show , her first , real public art show . @(Paintings) @!TAIBBI: @(Voiceover) As for John , he was getting some computer work , too . And while they were n't making a fortune , it was enough for the down payment on a new truck that they showed off one night for close friend , Sue Coffman. @(Photo-of-John-and- @!Ms-COFFMAN: That was an accomplishment on their part . ' Look , we have a truck . We 're making payments . We 're real people . ' @!TAIBBI: @(Voiceover) That truck would also be an important piece of the puzzle later on . But , for now , it let the struggling couple imagine a future of their own , away from that unhappy house . One evening the three friends sat in the truck making plans to take a road trip together . @(Photo-of-John-and- @!Ms-COFFMAN: So we were all very excited about it , and we 're planning it . @!TAIBBI: @(Voiceover) A few weeks later Linda called Sue out of the blue to say she and John were headed to New York . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needed to sign some paperwork. @(Telephone; @!Ms-COFFMAN: She says , ' And they want me , too . And I thought that was odd . I was like , ' Why would the government want you ? What do you know ? I mean , you can draw unicorns . ' @!TAIBBI: @(Voiceover) It sounded so far-fetched . Sue was n't sure she believed Linda , but she knew her friend would n't let her down , she 'd be back in time for their road trip . Except she was n't . Except she never showed . @(New-York-street; @!Ms-COFFMAN: Just disappears off the face of the earth forever as far as I could tell . @!TAIBBI: @(Voiceover) Linda never came home , never went back to work at the bookstore , never completed a painting someone had already paid for . It did n't make sense to Sue . @(Photo-of-Linda; @!Ms-COFFMAN: @(Voiceover) She just was n't a person that she 'd just leave , just leave it all and just blow it all off . And that 's when I said to myself ... @(Photo-of-Linda) @!Ms-COFFMAN: ... this is becoming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @(Voiceover) And now , nearly 10 years after Linda and John had disappeared , a skeleton had been discovered just yards from the house . @(Trees; @!Det-GOUGH: We immediately assumed that it was going to be a homicide . @!TAIBBI: @(Voiceover) Police stood watch through the night , waiting for the careful removal of the skeletal remains of a body still buried in the backyard . But whose body ? Had Linda been found at last ? @(Police-officers; @!HOLT: Coming up , the missing couple and that mysterious mission . @(Voiceover) The young husband 's mother says she knew all about it . @(Photo-of-John; @!Mr-MARK-SEAL: She goes , ' I have a source who 's giving me all of this information about where they are , what they 're doing . ' @!HOLT: @(Voiceover) Who was that source , and what did he know ? When Buried Secrets continues . @(Photo-of-John-and- @(Announcements) @!TAIBBI: @(Voiceover) May 1994 , a mummified skeleton , ID unknown , had been unearthed in the backyard of an old house . A young detective wondered if it had anything to do with the disappearance of two newlyweds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case file assembled by police back then . @(Title-graphic; @!Det-GOUGH: @(Voiceover) They had done interviews at that time ... @(Gough) @!Det-GOUGH: ... but now it takes on , of course , a more sinister air . @!TAIBBI: @(Voiceover) Back in February 1985 , Linda Sohus had told friends that unbelievable story that she and her husband John had been head hunted by the government for a secret mission and needed to go to New York to sign some paperwork . When Sue Coffman did n't hear from them for a few weeks , she called Linda 's mother-in-law , Didi , to find out where they were . @(Photo-of-Linda; @!Ms-COFFMAN: And she goes , ' Oh , they 're in Paris . And I 'm like Paris , California ? ' No , no , Paris , France . And I 'm like , what ? @!TAIBBI: @(Voiceover) As time passed , Linda 's sister , Kathy Jacoby , was worried , too . She was sure Linda would have been too excited to keep the details about a trip to Paris a secret . No , something else was going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I felt ... @(Paris) @!Ms-JACOBY: ... like , ' I need to find out what happened so I can be angry at her . ' @!TAIBBI: @(Voiceover) But her anger turned to concern when she got a call from the cat hotel where Linda had boarded her six beloved cats . The manager said Linda had n't picked them up , and they would soon be euthanized. @(Jacoby; -cats ; -phot @!Ms-JACOBY: @(Voiceover) She would have come back for her pets . I know it . @(Photo-of-Linda-and @!Ms-JACOBY: That 's when I went to the police . @!TAIBBI: @(Voiceover) Kathy called the San Marino police , asking them to go check on the couple . But when police dropped by the house , John 's mother Didi turned them away . Reporter Mark Seal . @(Exterior-of-police @!Mr-SEAL: She was adamant that they had gone on this mission for the US government , and that 's where they were . @(Voiceover) She goes , ' I have a source who 's giving me all of this information about where they are , what they 're doing , and he 's asking me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place in North Carolina . ' @!TAIBBI: @(Voiceover) A secret source keeping tabs on the couple ? Well , maybe that was how the missing couple finally got the message that their friends and family were worried about them because a few weeks later postcards arrived from Paris . @(Closed-window-blin @!Ms-COFFMAN: @(Voiceover) When I first saw the postcard , because I 'd heard the thing about Paris , I thought , Linda . So I turn it over , and she 's like " Kind of missed New York , oops , but this can be lived with . John and Linda . " @(Postcards) @!TAIBBI: @(Voiceover) Sue thought she recognized her friend 's handwriting , but it did n't stop her worrying . The flippant tone of the card seemed out of character . @(Coffman; -postcard ) @!Ms-COFFMAN: @(Voiceover) If you 've just been uprooted and left your cats ... @(Postcard) @!Ms-COFFMAN: ... and left your whole life , you 're not going to write this little bitty one-half of a sentence . You 're just not . @!TAIBBI: @(Voiceover) Still , there it was , an indication , anyway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's when the cops seemed to lose interest . @(Photo-of-John-and- @!Ms-COFFMAN: @(Voiceover) And they were like , ' Well , she 's over 21. ' @(Postcards; @!Ms-COFFMAN: ' If she does n't want to come back , she does n't have to . Nobody 's going to make her . And I kind of went -- I felt so sad at that . @!TAIBBI: @(Voiceover) And now , nine years later , Sue Coffman was talking to yet another set of investigators about her friend . A skeleton had been found buried in the backyard of John Sohus childhood home . Was it him ? Or could it be Sue 's best friend , Linda ? @(Trees; -sunlight ; -G @!Det-GOUGH: @(Voiceover) We had the sifters out there , we 're going through for trace evidence . @(Crime-scene) @!TAIBBI: @(Voiceover) The yard now resembled an archaeological dig , investigators down on their hands and knees searching for every shard of bone , every scrape of evidence . @(Crime-scene) @!Det-GOUGH: Somebody 's died , and it 's your responsibility to get some justice for them . @!TAIBBI: @(Voiceover) The skeleton was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's office . It was there that the plastic bags were removed and the body laid out piece by piece . Detective Gough saw right away that from the skeleton 's size and clothing it could n't be Linda . @(Body-room-at-coron @!Det-GOUGH: It appeared to be the same physical dimensions as John . And just the way the clothing was , it was similar to how John dressed , you know , jeans , a plaid red shirt . @!TAIBBI: Now it was official . What had been a missing persons case had now become a homicide investigation . And in 1994 , this is what investigators knew : Three people had lived in that crumbling house with its shuttered windows and stained walls . Gentle John Sohus had been buried in the backyard , his artist wife , Linda , was missing , and his mother , who was said to have raged at their marriage , was now dead . @(Voiceover) But the old woman had left behind one clue to the mystery . It was there in the case file . Didi Sohus had made her own panicked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Girardot ... @(Photo-of-Did; @!Mr-FRANK-GIRARDOT: She decides that she 's got to call the police and say , ' Hey , I need to you find my son and his wife . They 've been gone for four months , and they have n't heard from them . @!TAIBBI: Now , this is a change from what she 'd told the police prior to that time . @!Mr-GIRARDOT: Big change . Huge change . @!TAIBBI: @(Voiceover) What had changed her mind ? Well , she said that her secret source , the one who 'd been feeding information to her about John and Linda 's covert mission , had vanished , and he 'd taken the couple 's truck with him . @(Police-department; @!Det-GOUGH: It just takes on a whole nother arena of questions without answers . @!TAIBBI: @(Voiceover) Investigators now needed to take into account one more person , Didi 's secret source . Who was he ? And , if he could be found , could he lead them to the missing Linda and to information about John Sohus killer ? @(Closed-window-blin @!HOLT: @(Voiceover) Coming up , the investigation shifts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ claimed to be a rich aristocrat , but he did n't live like one . @(Gough; @!Ms-CAROL-CAMPBELL: If you profess to be from all this nobility and wealth , why are you driving this ? @!HOLT: @(Voiceover) When DATELINE continues . @(DATELINE-graphic) @(Announcements) @!TAIBBI: @(Voiceover) The sedate signs of springtime in San Marino -- sprinklers turning on , the drifting sounds of cocktail chatter -- had been supplanted by something much uglier. @(Title-graphic; -San Unidentified Reporter 1 : The body was found buried three and a half feet down . @!TAIBBI: @(Voiceover) The discovery of John Sohus skeleton in May 1994 , was big news . @(Exterior-of-house; Unidentified Reporter 2 : It was cut into three pieces , stored in plastic bags . @!TAIBBI: @(Voiceover) Detective Tricia Gough was helping the LA County Sheriff 's Department try and figure out who had killed the shy computer programmer . One name stood out in the case file put together by detectives when John and his wife , Linda , had first gone missing . @(Gough; @!Det-GOUGH: He was one of the last people to have lived at the house . @!TAIBBI: @(Voiceover) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ renting the guest house from John 's mother , a modest structure behind the main house where John and Linda lived . @(Photo-of-Gerhartsr @!TAIBBI: What did your colleagues know who 'd looked at the missing persons case years before that ? @!Det-GOUGH: Kind of a prissy kind of guy . The way he came across , he just did n't seem to be that type of person who would have done anything you would consider violent or nefarious. @!TAIBBI: @(Voiceover) But now investigators decided to take another look at Chichester . They fanned out across the neighborhood to find out what people remembered . @(Photo-of-Gerhartsr @!Ms-MEREDITH-BRUCKE: Here 's a young man who 's well dressed , well spoken , fun and friendly . @!TAIBBI: @(Voiceover) Like so many others in San Marino , novelist Meredith Brucker had met Chichester on the patio of the Church of Our Savior . The young Englishman had told her that he was an aspiring film producer . She watched him mingle with the well-heeled congregation over coffee and cake after Sunday services . @(Meredith-Brucker-a @!Ms-BRUCKER: @(Voiceover) He could talk about ... @(Exterior-of-church @!Ms-BRUCKER: ... anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buttons . @!TAIBBI: And you 're not saying this in a negative way . @!Ms-BRUCKER: Right . He was very interested in people . @!TAIBBI: @(Voiceover) And people were very interested in him , for there on his business card was a heraldic seal . He was none other than the 13th baronet of Chichester . @(Photo-of-Gerhartsr @!Ms-BRUCKER: I just called him Chichester because the name just seems -- and he even laughed about it being pretentious . @!TAIBBI: Yeah . @!Ms-BRUCKER: So he was self-deprecating , he could laugh about himself . @!TAIBBI: @(Voiceover) By day , he told people , he attended film classes at USC . You can see him for yourself acting in this student horror movie . By night , Chichester could be found squiring rich widows to San Marino social events , regaling dinner guests with stories of his massive fortune . Cori Woods was just a child , but Chichester 's stories had made quite an impression on her . @(Film-projector; @!Ms-CORI-WOODS: He 'd bought a castle in England , and he wanted to ship it over here brick by brick . @!TAIBBI: That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -- and , of course , we thought , ' Well , that would be a great idea . ' @!TAIBBI: @(Voiceover) Pretty soon Chichester had become the town 's most eligible bachelor. @(Photo-of-Gerhartsr @!Ms-CAMPBELL: My father introduced us. @!TAIBBI: @(Voiceover) Carol Campbell was home from college when her father fixed her up with Chichester on a date . @(Photo-of-Carol-Cam @!Ms-CAMPBELL: So I assumed it was lunch , but instead we went on a series of errands , like to the post office . @!TAIBBI: @(Voiceover) Hardly the behavior she 'd been expecting . Carol could n't understand what all the fuss was about , especially when he showed up in a junker of a car . @(Tree-lined-street; @!Ms-CAMPBELL: If you profess to be from all of this nobility and wealth , why are driving this ? It did n't add up . @!TAIBBI: @(Voiceover) Nine years on , Detective Gough was skeptical , too . People around town who 'd praised Chichester to police investigating the missing persons case , had a more jaded view of the young man now . The suave baronet who had dropped heavy hints about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come to think of it , had lived in relative squalor . @(Gough; @!Ms-BRUCKER: @(Voiceover) I think I remember a little single bed pushed against the wall . @(Mattress-on-floor) @!Ms-BRUCKER: It was horrible . I do n't even think -- he 'd had no kitchen that I know of . @!TAIBBI: @(Voiceover) And there was something else a little bit off about the town 's most eligible bachelor . Cori Woods was n't even a teenager when 20-something Chichester asked her to the movies . You were how old then ? @(San-Marino-streets @!Ms-WOODS: @(Voiceover) Maybe 12. @(Photo-of-Woods-and @!Ms-WOODS: And my mom said a very definitive no . And then after that , you know , it got a little weird and he started asking other inappropriate girls out . @!TAIBBI: Not age appropriate . @!Ms-WOODS: Not age appropriate . @!TAIBBI: @(Voiceover) In the meantime , investigators wondered whether Chichester had been escorting rich widows around town with an eye on their money . @(Photo-of-Gerhartsr @!Det-GOUGH: Somehow he ended up in clubs and places where the wealthier members of San Marino . @!TAIBBI: Church of Our Savior. @!Det-GOUGH: Right . Where they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across after a while as being kind of sneaky and manipulative. @!TAIBBI: @(Voiceover) Detective Gough quickly established two facts about the fantastical Chichester . The film student who watched Hitchcock movies late into the night in the guest house , had never been registered at USC , and he was no blue blood . There was no 13th baronet of Chichester . @(Gough; @!TAIBBI: Was there a point when you were researching this guy , and you said to yourself , ' You know what , this guy is n't just a phony , he 's a 14 karat phony ' ? @!Det-GOUGH: Oh , yeah . But you have to be impressed . I mean , and people bought it hook , line , and sinker . @!TAIBBI: @(Voiceover) Were there also tall tales the fake baronet had sold to John and Linda Sohus when they were all living so close together ? Police wondered if Chichester had been after Didi 's modest savings , too . @(Photo-of-John-and- @!Det-GOUGH: You have these probably naive , not very worldly people and a master manipulator. @!TAIBBI: And always somewhere in that mix @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , if you 're in San Marino there 's money somewhere . @!TAIBBI: @(Voiceover) Detective Gough was n't sure what to make of it . It was clear that investigators needed to find Christopher Chichester and to find out if he knew anything about John Sohus death . @(Gough; @!HOLT: Coming up , the next clue on the trail of a phony aristocrat. @!Det-GOUGH: @(Voiceover) We were able to grab one of the prints from there ... @(Photo-of-Gerhartsr @!Det-GOUGH: ... and that 's how we were able to finally have a fingerprint . @!HOLT ; -@1Voiceover@# @(Photos-of-Gerharts @(Announcements) @!TAIBBI: @(Voiceover) John Sohus mother , Didi , sat by the phone waiting for her missing son to call . He 'd vanished without a word in 1985 . Almost 10 years later , John 's skeleton had been unearthed in the backyard of his home not far from where his mother had been sitting . Detective Tricia Gough was trying to build a profile of the mysterious man who 'd been living in the guest house at the time John died . @(Title-graphic; @!TAIBBI: What vision of or image of him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people , manipulative . I mean , the guy just shows up out of nowhere and is able to , you know , pretty much get free rent . @!TAIBBI: @(Voiceover) But that did n't make him a murderer . What 's more , the detective noted , Chichester had continued to live in the guest house for months after John must have been killed . He 'd even thrown parties there . @(Photo-of-Gerhartsr @!TAIBBI: That 's pretty cold-blooded if this is a murderer , is n't it ? @!Det-GOUGH: Right . @!TAIBBI: @(Voiceover) Meredith Brucker had been one of Chichester 's party guests . He 'd invited her to play Trivial Pursuit in the backyard where John Sohus dismembered body would be found years later . @(Brucker-and-Taibbi @!Ms-BRUCKER: When I looked around this yard , it was a big yard , totally unkempt , overgrown , ungardened , just a mess . @!TAIBBI: @(Voiceover) And she noticed something else that investigators would find interesting . Chichester appeared to have the run of the place , including the main house where John 's mother , Didi , lived . @(Plant; @!Ms-BRUCKER: @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soft drinks . So he says , ' Let 's go up in the front house . And I said , ' Well , can you just go in there ? ' Oh , yeah , no problem . ' @!TAIBBI: But it was what the detective learned next that convinced her that Chichester just might know what had happened to John and Linda . It turns out that Didi had told police the identity of her secret source . She said the person who had filled her head with all the hush-hush details about John and Linda 's mysterious government mission , the person who 'd reassured her that her son was alive , that all was well , was none other than Christopher Chichester . @!Det-GOUGH: Chichester has been telling her that he 's in contact with them and for her not to contact or tell anybody , that all the information will come through him . @!TAIBBI: @(Voiceover) And there was other evidence suggesting that Chichester had been up to no good . One of his neighbors told Detective Gough about a smell coming from the guest house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 10 years . @(Exterior-of-house- @!Det-GOUGH: @(Voiceover) There had been something burning in the fireplace ... @(Fire) @!Det-GOUGH: ... and it went on for a while , and he went next door and said , ' Whatever you 're doing , can you knock it off ? And Chichester appeared to be pretty startled and said , ' Oh , absolutely . ' @!TAIBBI: @(Voiceover) What had Chichester been burning ? And why he had been so jumpy about it ? Nearly 10 years on , was there any physical evidence left behind to tell investigators what Chichester had been doing ? Crime scene technicians waited until 2 in the morning to spray the guest house with luminol , that chemical that glows when it comes into contact with blood . The results were chilling . @(Photo-of-Gerhartsr @!Det-GOUGH: It lit up like a Christmas tree . There was the appearance of body fluids on the floor and on the walls , and there was an extensive amount . @!TAIBBI: @(Voiceover) Body fluids , most probably blood , had pooled on the floor of the guest house . Detective Gough speculated that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smell that the neighbor had complained about . @(Crime-scene-photo) @!Det-GOUGH: Maybe he had sopped up the towels . Maybe he was burning the carpet . @!TAIBBI: @(Voiceover) Now the detective had no doubt . @(Gough) @!Det-GOUGH: I absolutely felt like Chichester was involved . There just ca n't be that many coincidence in a single case . @!TAIBBI: @(Voiceover) Tricia Gough no longer thought that Chichester was just a person with information about the case . She believed he was a murderer . But where was he now ? He 'd long since left town . @(Photo-of-Gerhartsr @!Mr-WAYNE-CALLAN: He would show up , you know , out of the blue and just go sit by our pool . @!TAIBBI: @(Voiceover) Investigators tracked down a family who had known Chichester throughout his time in San Marino , a family who knew that he 'd been faking it all this time . @(Callans-looking-at @!Mr-CALLAN: @(Voiceover) He had to be himself here . @(Callans-looking-at @!Mr-CALLAN: He could n't tell us he was royalty or whatever . @!TAIBBI: @(Voiceover) Because the Callans knew who Chichester really was . Wayne 's parents had first met him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Far from being an English baronet , Chichester was a German immigrant named Christian Gerhartsreiter . Once in a while the young German would escape his life in San Marino to spend time with the Callans . But they told investigators that their friend had seemed depressed around the time that John and Linda disappeared . @(Callans-looking-at @!Mr-CALLAN: He seemed very dejected like , you know , it just has n't worked out . @!TAIBBI: @(Voiceover) Chichester told Wayne Callan that he was leaving town and heading east to become a stockbroker , but he left no forwarding address . And it all seemed like another dead end . Or was it ? Investigators had noticed a report tucked into the missing persons case file which confirmed that Chichester had made it to the East Coast . @(Photo-of-Gerhartsr @!Det-GOUGH: Suddenly , it surfaces in Connecticut . @!TAIBBI: @(Voiceover) Three years after Chichester had left San Marino , he tried to sell Linda and John 's prize possession , their truck , in Connecticut . It was a big mistake . @(San-Marino; @!Det-GOUGH: So when it shows up and he 's trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... @!TAIBBI: @(Voiceover) The DMV reported Chichester to the police and revealed something crucial , the identity that he 'd been using when he tried to sell the truck : Christopher Crowe , stockbroker. @(Photo-of-Gerhartsr @!Det-GOUGH: And , of course , when you become a stockbroker you have to have your prints on file , you have to take certain tests and so forth . And we were able to grab one of the prints from there , and that 's how we were able to finally have a fingerprint . @!TAIBBI: @(Voiceover) Gough and her colleagues searched for Crowe , but no luck . Still , having the con man 's fingerprint on file meant that police had something tangible that could help them identify him if he should surface down the road . Whatever identity or role he had now assumed , he was in the system . But as quickly as things came together , it seemed the investigation fell apart . @(Photo-of-Gerhartsr @!Det-GOUGH: We had made so much progress in the beginning , you know , and finding the fingerprint and finding the different names . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together , and just stopped . @!TAIBBI: Did it occur to you that ' This guy may be in the wind . We may never get him ' ? @!Det-GOUGH: He 'd been in the wind for quite some time , and his trail had just stopped . I thought , ' He could be anywhere in the world . ' @!TAIBBI: @(Voiceover) And then , before she knew it , Tricia Gough was off the case , promoted to sergeant . And her colleagues at the LA County Sheriff 's Department were distracted by another famous murder case . The years passed . But , as time went on , there was always someone out there pestering investigators , keeping the newlyweds memory alive , Linda 's best friend , Sue Coffman. @(Photo-of-Gough; @!Ms-COFFMAN: They 're just a mystery , they 're just some people out there that randomly had bad things happen to them , and it 's never been -- it 's never been dug into enough , I do n't think . @!TAIBBI: @(Voiceover) Until the unexpected happened in the summer of 2008 , a family drama @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would make headlines across the country and rouse the ghosts of Linda Sohus and her dead husband , John . Were investigators about to find out what had happened all those years ago ? @(Exterior-of-apartm @!HOLT: @(Voiceover) Coming up ... @(Crime-scene-photo) @!Det-GOUGH: When I saw in it the newspaper , I knew that was him . @!HOLT: @(Voiceover) Hiding in plain sight , Chichester 's astonishing new identity . @(Exterior-of-buildi @!Mr-BILL-QUIGLEY: The waiters would refer to him as Mr. Rockefeller , and ' How are you , Mr. Rockefeller ? ' @!HOLT: @(Voiceover) When DATELINE continues . @(DATELINE-graphic) @(Announcements) @!Det-GOUGH: I was shocked . Absolutely shocked . @!TAIBBI: @(Voiceover) Tricia Gough could n't believe it . At long last , the search was over . The face of the man who had eluded California homicide detectives for years was staring out of her morning newspaper . @(Gough; @!Det-GOUGH: When I saw it in the newspaper , I knew that was him . @!TAIBBI: @(Voiceover) But nearly 15 years after a bulldozer had disturbed John Sohus makeshift grave , investigators could barely believe where the man they knew as Christopher Chichester been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his boldest persona yet . @(Bulldozer-digging; @!Mr-QUIGLEY: The waiters would refer to him as Mr. Rockefeller , and ' How are you Mr. Rockefeller ? And ... @(Voiceover) ... he had this air about him . @(Bill-Quigley) @!TAIBBI: @(Voiceover) It was back in the early ' 90s that artist Bill Quigley met the man calling himself James Frederick Mills Clark Rockefeller -- yes , Quigley , understood , one of those Rockefellers -- who said he was worth $400 million . @(Quigley; @!Mr-QUIGLEY: He paid for everything we did . I do n't think I ever remember paying for anything . @!TAIBBI: @(Voiceover) Unlike his time slumming it in that San Marino guest house , Rockefeller , aka Christopher Chichester , was living the high life and seemed to have the money to pay for it . There was fine dining at exclusive private clubs , a priceless art collection hanging on his walls , or so he said . @(Mattress-on-floor; @!Ms-ROXANNE-WEST: I was standing there looking at a painting , and he came over and introduced himself to me. @!TAIBBI: @(Voiceover) Socialite Roxanne West met the fake Rockefeller at cocktail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her , much as he had those rich San Marino widows all those years before . @(Photo-of-Roxanne-W @!Ms-WEST: He was so mild mannered and so soft spoken and very polite and a gentleman . @!TAIBBI: @(Voiceover) And he asked for the socialite 's phone number . When he texted her a few days later , Rockefeller told Roxanne he was giving a private tour of the Met . It was the beginning of a text message relationship that was , by turns , fun , far out , flirty . " I did want to tell you that I find you superbly -- never mind , " Rockefeller wrote . " Perhaps go to Central Park and kiss for an hour or so ? " And then a few days later , " In a submarine , crowded , strange , thought of you just a minute ago . " @(West; @!Ms-WEST: The texts were so wild and so ... @(Voiceover) ... far-fetched , I would just giggle ... @(Photo-of-Gerhartsr @!Ms-WEST: ... and go where does he come up with this stuff ? @!Mr-SEAL: Wherever he went , he met people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lie after lie . @!TAIBBI: @(Voiceover) Reporter Mark Seal profiled the inventor of all those lies in his book " The Man in the Rockefeller Suit . " @(Book) @!Mr-SEAL: He 's proof that no matter , you know , what you say , you know , if it 's wrapped in a famous name people tend to believe it . @!TAIBBI: @(Voiceover) The most important believer , Rockefeller 's wife of 12 years . Sophisticated , Harvard educated Sandra Boss . After their daughter was born , the con man settled into the perfect cover , a devoted family man living an admirable , upscale life in Boston 's Beacon Hill . @(Exterior-of-buildi @!Ms-AMY-PATT: He always had a smile , always , you know , chipper and cheery and is n't the world lovely ? @!TAIBBI: @(Voiceover) Amy Patt became friends with Rockefeller at the school bus stop . A couple of loving parents , Rockefeller , a stay at home dad to his little girl . @(Amy-Patt; @!Ms-PATT: I saw Clark as ... @(Voiceover) ... a doting father . He would carry her on his shoulder . @(Photo-of-Gerhartsr @!Ms-PATT: @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @(Voiceover) Here was one relationship that the con man was n't faking , but that relationship was torn away from him when his wife announced she was divorcing him . @(Photo-of-little-gi @!Ms-PATT: His whole life was turned upside down . @!TAIBBI: @(Voiceover) Sandra Boss moved to London and took their daughter with her . Rockefeller was devastated when a judge ruled that he could only have three supervised visits a year with the daughter he adored . @(London; @!Ms-PATT: He would say things like , ' I think I 'm just going to get in a boat and go away and , you know , never come back . ' @!TAIBBI: @(Voiceover) What Amy did n't know was that Rockefeller had a special talent for disappearing . But this time he would be taking someone with him , and that would ultimately be his undoing . July 27 , 2008 , a sultry afternoon on a tree-lined block in Boston 's Back Bay . It was the first of Rockefeller 's supervised visits with his daughter since she 'd moved to London . And as they walked to lunch he suddenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with her , father and daughter . @(Photos-of-Gerharts Unidentified Dispatcher : ( From 911 audiotape ) Hello , Boston Police .

She told Boston police she had no idea where to start looking for her ex-husband because , during the divorce proceedings , she 'd discovered something that shocked her . Everything he had told her about himself had been a lie , everything . She did n't even know his real name . @(Boss-at-kidnapping @!Mr-THOMAS-LEE: They put the photo out right away and got the Amber Alert started immediately . @!TAIBBI: @(Voiceover) Boston police Deputy Superintendent Thomas Lee bet that someone somewhere would recognize the kidnapper. @(Amber-Alert-sign; - Unidentified Reporter 3 : The 48-year-old Rockefeller ... @!TAIBBI: @(Voiceover) His face flashed across TV screens nationwide . @(Gerhartsreiter-on- @!Mr-GIRARDOT: People here who saw the picture said , ' That 's Chris . That 's Christopher Chichester . ' @!TAIBBI: @(Voiceover) Was Rockefeller the Boston kidnapper really Chichester @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for investigators to make the connection . Those fingerprints that Detective Tricia Gough had tracked down from Chichester 's days as a stockbroker because it turned out that Clark Rockefeller -- so careful , so calculating -- had also left behind some fingerprint evidence in his high-living Boston days . @(Photos-of-Gerharts @!Mr-LEE: @(Voiceover) It was a wine glass left at an acquaintance 's house . @(Wine-glass) @!Mr-LEE: Off of that glass , we were able to lift some prints . @!TAIBBI: @(Voiceover) Presto , a match . Now , police on two coasts knew for sure that Rockefeller and Chichester were the same person . @(Photos-of-Gerharts @!TAIBBI: What feelings were stirred up for you when that happened ? @!Det-GOUGH: I was elated . I was hoping finally there would be some justice for John . @!TAIBBI: @(Voiceover) But before there could be justice for John , police would have to catch a man skilled enough to have eluded law enforcement for 20 years , skills that had Sue Coffman , the best friend of one of his possible victims , eternally frustrated . @(Photo-of-John; @!Ms-COFFMAN: Somebody once told me , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him .

And he rolls it up immediately and takes off . @(Announcements) @!TAIBBI: @(Voiceover) Clark Rockefeller , aka Christopher Chichester , was a man on the run . For years he 'd managed to dodge law enforcement , but now , six days after he 'd snatched his daughter off a Boston street , police were finally closing in. @(Title-graphic; @!Mr-LEE: We were looking at this now as a person who may be a homicide-suicide situation . We did n't know what could transpire. @!TAIBBI: @(Voiceover) But then a lucky break , a tip from Baltimore pinpointing the phony Rockefeller 's hideout , a carriage house where they arrested him and found his daughter playing with her dolls . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She just fainted . She fainted dead away . @!TAIBBI: @(Voiceover) Across the country in California , Tricia Gough , now retired from the police department , watched Rockefeller 's arrest with one hope , that the con man would finally reveal what he knew about John and Linda Sohus. @(Gough) @!Det-GOUGH: But I also knew that this guy was very intelligent , and he probably would not talk . @!TAIBBI: @(Voiceover) And she was right . Rockefeller turned California investigators away at his cell door , but he did agree to talk NBC 's Natalie Morales in August 2008 , just a few weeks after his arrest . @(Arrest-photo-of-Ge @!NATALIE-MORALES-re: Are you a mystery man ? @!Mr-GERHARTSREITER: I 'd like to be known as a good man , if anything . I 'd like to be known as a quiet man , living a quiet life . @!TAIBBI: @(Voiceover) Rockefeller admitted that he had used fake names in his life , Christopher Chichester one of them , he said . But when it came to the Sohus investigation , his attorney did most of the talking . @(Photos-of-Gerharts @!MORALES: Did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3 : Yeah , there 's no dispute he lived there in the back ... @!MORALES: In the guest house . Man 3 : ... place . Many people put him there . @!MORALES: As Christopher Chichester . Man 3 : Yeah , many people put him there . @!MORALES: Did you kill John and Linda Sohus ? @!Mr-GERHARTSREITER: My entire life , I 've always been a pacifist . I 'm a Quaker , and I believe in nonviolence . And I can fairly certainly say that I 've never hurt anyone . @!TAIBBI: @(Voiceover) That 's all he had to say about the Sohuses while he was in jail . And he remained equally tight lipped during his trial on parental kidnapping charges . @(Photo-of-John-and- Unidentified Man 4 : ( In court ) The defendant is guilty of offenses charged . @!TAIBBI: @(Voiceover) And just this week , he was back in court . @(Court-in-session) Unidentified Man 5 : ( In court ) Mr. Gerhartsreiter ... @!TAIBBI: @(Voiceover) But this time in California , this time accused of murder .

He has pleaded not guilty . @(Court-in-session; - Man 4 : ( In court ) And the people may call their next witness . @!TAIBBI: @(Voiceover) The judge allowed our cameras into the hearing , but would not let us broadcast any witness testimony . Still , it was a first glimpse at the case . Front and center , the crime scene photos . A forensic pathologist said , ' Look at John 's skull , fractured in three places . ' @(Court-in-session) @!Mr-GIRARDOT: The inference is that John was struck three times in the head with a blunt object that appeared to be rounded like a baseball bat . @!TAIBBI: @(Voiceover) That skull and the rest of John 's skeleton had been found in plastic bags , witnesses testified . But it was one bag in particular that the prosecution argued could be a possible clue to the killer 's identity . @(Crime-scene-photo; @!Mr-GIRARDOT: Talk about a huge piece of evidence and one that 's going to be really hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a small plastic book bag with a University of Wisconsin logo . Rockefeller had briefly been a student there . @(Book-bag; @!Mr-GIRARDOT: There 's a book bag at this crime scene in California 1500 miles away from that very same place . @!TAIBBI: @(Voiceover) The prosecution then presented witnesses who remembered suspicious details from all those years ago . A neighbor who says he lent the defendant a chain saw . Had it been used to cut the body to pieces ? And this man , a friend from bible study group who said the con man had tried to sell him and his wife a bloodstained rug before he left town . @(Court-in-session; @!Mr-GIRARDOT: And the wife says , ' Chris , there 's a bloodstain on this rug , and he rolls it up immediately and says , ' Never mind , and takes off . @!TAIBBI: @(Voiceover) But it was this petite , respectable looking woman , an ex-fiancee , who reveals something detectives had never known before , the defendant 's panic when he thought the law was closing in . It turns out he knew police @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sell John and Linda 's truck in Connecticut , and his reaction had been dramatic . He 'd gone underground for years , his ex testified . Had dyed his hair blond and swapped his trademark glasses for contacts . He 'd lived like a hunted man . @(Court-in-session; @!Mr-JEFFREY-DENNER: And the prosecution 's case ... @!TAIBBI: @(Voiceover) Rockefeller 's defense attorneys , Jeffrey Denner and Brad Bailey , say he is innocent . The prosecution 's case is circumstantial and full of holes . @(Jeffrey-Denner-and @!Mr-BRAD-BAILEY: We did n't see anything that we would describe as a smoking gun . @!TAIBBI: @(Voiceover) In court , they suggested that there was no proof that John Sohus had been bludgeoned to death . They say the bobcats digging that swimming pool could have easily crushed the buried skull . @(Court-in-session; - Unidentified Man 6 : ( In court ) How is your memory in general from that period of time ? @!TAIBBI: @(Voiceover) The defense also questioned the credibility of prosecution witnesses describing events decades old . @(Court-in-session) @!Mr-DENNER: People who had relevant things to say years and years ago perhaps are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot of times their memories fade . @!TAIBBI: @(Voiceover) Just as susceptible to the passage of time , they argued , was the physical evidence . There was no doubt there had been blood found in the guest house , but who 's blood ? And then there was Linda , and a whiff of a suggestion from the defense that she and not their client could have had a hand in whatever happened to John . @(Light; @!Mr-GIRARDOT: Certainly the absence of Linda ... @!TAIBBI: Is huge . @!Mr-GIRARDOT: ... is a big hole in the case . If you 're the defense , you 're looking at Linda as , ' Hey , where is she ? ' @!TAIBBI: Was she responsible ? @!Mr-GIRARDOT: ' Why is n't she possibly responsible for , you know , ' having done this ? ' @!TAIBBI: @(Voiceover) Investigators have returned to the backyard in 2008 with cadaver dogs and sonar devices looking for Linda 's body , but it was n't there . @(Investigators; @!TAIBBI: You believed , and still believe , that she 's alive ? @!Det-GOUGH: I do . @!TAIBBI: @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know , but from her months on the case she thinks that Linda survived whatever happened in the guest house the night of John 's murder and might even have been involved . @(Gough; @!Det-GOUGH: Maybe she wanted out of that marriage and the plan that Chichester had gave her an opportunity . @!TAIBBI: @(Voiceover) She points to those postcards sent from Paris months after John 's body was in the ground , postcards that seem to have been written by Linda . And there have been several claimed sightings of Linda since she disappeared . @(Gough; -postcards ; - @!Mr-CALLAN: There was a woman sitting in a truck , it was a midsized truck . @!TAIBBI: @(Voiceover) Wayne Callan , the son of the sweet couple who knew Rockefeller 's real identity , says he saw both Rockefeller and a woman he thinks was Linda in a truck parked at his parents house . @(Wayne; @!Mr-CALLAN: As I passed , she looked me right in the eyes and her eyes were all blotchy red all around .

Really interesting company based in Brooklyn called Bummer Baskets . @!KOTB: OK. @!Ms-THOMAS: After a bunch of their friends had a run of bad luck , summer romances ending , etc. , he decided that flowers died , chocolates are calories , so he creates personalized bummer baskets that have these oversized wine glasses , funny customized cards like this heart being run over by a tire , etc. @!GIFFORD: Aw . @!KOTB: OK. @!Ms-THOMAS: Love them . Also , you have some happy shots in front of you . @!KOTB: What is it ? @!Ms-THOMAS: These are Be Happy Shots that claim to restore ... @!KOTB: Is it B-12 ? @!Ms-THOMAS: ... your neurotransmitters that actually make us feel naturally happy .

I 'm waiting to see if you like it . @!KOTB: Nasty . @!GIFFORD: Nope . @!KOTB: Try it . @!Ms-THOMAS: And last but not least , I 'm a big fan of beauty and how it always perks you up .

So here 's -- here it is . You guys talk to her if you do n't like this one . @!KOTB: OK. @!GIFFORD: An elderly couple is sitting on the porch swing just swinging away together when all of a sudden the wife hauls off and smacks the husband . Surprised , he asks , ' What was that for ? to which she replies , ' 50 years of bad sex . A few minutes pass when the husband returns the smack and the wife asks , ' Well , what was that for ? ' @!KOTB: Mm-hmm . @!GIFFORD: The husband says , ' For knowing the difference . ' @!KOTB: That was good . @!GIFFORD: More than I generally get . @!KOTB: That was good . @!GIFFORD: All right . Thank you . @!KOTB: All right . If you have a messy desk at work ... @!GIFFORD: And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mine 's not that bad . I really don't. @!GIFFORD: Hodi do do . @!KOTB: I do n't think my desk is that messy . @!GIFFORD: We should take a shot of it . @!KOTB: Yeah . Oh . @!GIFFORD: That is your desk , Hoda. @!KOTB: Yeah . And that 's not a bad day . Somebody cleaned it up . I want to thank Kathy Rhine , my assistant , for helping . But -- by the way , they say that people with messy desks like that one are actually -- they have a clearer thought process . @!GIFFORD: How is that possible , Hoda woman ? @!KOTB: Because you have to think through all the clutter and you zero in on the idea , because all this stuff 's happening around you , you just zero in . Do you believe it ? @!GIFFORD: No. @!KOTB: You do n't ? @!GIFFORD: I do n't , I do n't . I can not -- I can not deal with that kind of a ... @!KOTB: You ca n't function . @!GIFFORD: I ca n't function at all . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kids today study . @!KOTB: Look at your desk . Is that yours ? Offscreen Voice : Yeah . @!KOTB: Oh , my gosh . @!GIFFORD: Yeah , but ... @!KOTB: Look at that . @!GIFFORD: No , but that 's when I had just unpacked from coming back from Seattle and that 's all my scripts and everything on there . @!KOTB: That 's on a -- that 's a messy day . @!GIFFORD: Yeah , but that 's not a desk I work at . @!KOTB: You just put things on that desk ? @!GIFFORD: That 's a -- that 's a desk to put stuff on . @!KOTB: Oh . @!GIFFORD: That 's right . Yeah . @!KOTB: I did n't know that they even had those . @!GIFFORD: I ca n't work there , there 's no place to work . And , Christine , I 'm going to kill you . But the good news is that even -- that Albert Einstein apparently , who had a horrendously messy environment ... @!KOTB: Yeah . @!GIFFORD: Yeah . @!KOTB: He -- and he was genius . @!GIFFORD: @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agree with that .

##4103531 @!FISHER , co-host : It 's like ... Offscreen Voice : And it 's 2012. @!HODA-KOTB-co-host: Did I say 2011 ? Offscreen Voice : 2010. @!KOTB: 2012 . It 's 2012 , apparently , for ... @!FISHER: Well , not with that music , it 's ... @!KOTB: Right . It 's actually 19 -- what is it -- 80 ? @!FISHER: 2056. @!KOTB: 2056. @!FISHER: I think -- yeah . @!KOTB: I know . People still to this day -- and I know -- does it get on your nerves when people think " Star Wars , " Princess Leia and come up and ask you a million questions ? @!FISHER: No , that would -- well , I 'm getting a little -- I should be Queen Leia , you know ? @!KOTB: Yeah . @!FISHER: But I -- the music following me , you know . Imagine walking down the street -- no , my favorite thing is people saying , ' Princess Leia , and I 'm supposed to go , ' Yes ? Like I forget that 's not my real name . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you a lot for is your tremendous weight loss . That was one of those things that we saw before pictures and then you went on Jenny Craig . And these are the before and afters . @!FISHER: Oh , my God . @!KOTB: What ? What do you mean ? When you look at those pictures , what do you think ? What do you think of the before you and ... @!FISHER: Horror . @!KOTB: What are you talking ... @!FISHER: Just horror . Well , no , the after part is fine , but look what I allowed myself to -- that was the thing ... @!KOTB: What ? @!FISHER: ... where someone said , ' Whatever happened to Carrie Fisher ? She used to be so hot , now she looks like Elton John . Which is not nice to Elton John , I feel , but there you have it . @!KOTB: How long did it take to drop all that weight ? @!FISHER: I started at Thanksgiving ... @!KOTB: Yeah . @!FISHER: ... so that was the ... @!KOTB: Yeah . @!FISHER: ... jumping off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months . OK. @!FISHER: Yeah . Sort of like a pregnancy , but there was no child at the end that I 'm aware of . There might be . @!KOTB: Do you still eat the Jenny Craig food and do all that ? @!FISHER: I 'm very involved in their snacks . @!KOTB: I saw you having some cookies today . @!FISHER: Well , my big thing is it feels like -- what is that called -- you know , like it 's -- I 'm a truant and the -- they 're hiding the snacks from me at their house . So that 's my new -- that is sad . You guys are hiding the drinks in the morning . @!KOTB: Yeah . @!FISHER: In the morning . @!KOTB: We hid the -- I know , we -- because you 're -- you do n't drink , so we cleared the table of all things alcoholic . @!FISHER: Oh , is n't that nice ? @!KOTB: Was n't it sweet of us ? @!FISHER: And then I 'll come back on and I 'll have -- there 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By the way , I know that there were all those rumors about the face-lift. @!FISHER: Oh , my -- it 's so my favorite . @!KOTB: Are you sick of that ? @!FISHER: No , no , this is new . @!KOTB: Tell me. @!FISHER: Why did n't I get my neck done , then ? And they -- not -- the great thing is ... @!KOTB: Yeah . @!FISHER: ... that there 's doctors that weigh in , as it were ... @!KOTB: Yeah . @!FISHER: ... on my appearance and apparently they did n't -- I did n't -- it 's not a good job . I 'll say . So there 's like three doctors saying it 's clear that she had the lift and it 's a little too ... @!KOTB: Yeah . @!FISHER: ... you know , and I do n't know what else -- I had so many things done . @!KOTB: Have you ever had any work done ? @!FISHER: Well , yard work . @!KOTB: Yeah . That 's it . @!FISHER: No . I -- you know , like the Botox. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Botox and all that stuff . @!FISHER: OK. @!KOTB: We had your mom on the other day . @!FISHER: She looks better than any -- except my daughter . @!KOTB: She looks great . But it was a little bit of a weird experience for us , I have to say . @!FISHER: I heard she used the word " tits " a lot . @!KOTB: Yeah , she did . @!FISHER: It runs in the family . @!KOTB: She wanted -- look , look -- she wanted everyone grabbing hers . No , she threw the dress open , and you 'll see , she 's going in , Kath 's going in . And then in the commercial break -- we have a shot of it , it really happened . @!FISHER: Of her tits ? Well , that 's so great . @!KOTB: Of -- well , of -- no , of ... @!FISHER: Well , that -- it comes with age that you start , you know , exposing yourself . I 'm about five years away . @!KOTB: Well , she kept asking ' how do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you live , by the way , just around the corner from your mom , do n't you ? @!FISHER: Right near her breasts , yeah . @!KOTB: Near her breasts . @!FISHER: But -- yeah . @!KOTB: How is that , living so close in proximity to your mom ? @!FISHER: Well , we 're both on the road for a long time . And there 's a hill between us ... @!KOTB: Yeah . @!FISHER: ... and between her arthritis and my bursitis , we -- it 's getting a little weirder as we go along . @!KOTB: Yeah . @!FISHER: So I 'm moving . No , no , I 'm not . No , it 's fine . Except my mother now goes out and does interviews saying , ' Well , it 's -- our relationship is very volatile . ' @!KOTB: Yeah , she says that . @!FISHER: Really ? Who -- no one told me that . I thought we were getting along really well . So , you know , that 's how I keep up with what she thinks of me. @!KOTB: @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? @!FISHER: Well , it 's certainly not , I believe , typical . @!KOTB: Yeah . @!FISHER: But it 's -- my mother had me go and get my doctorate ... @!KOTB: Yeah . Yeah . @!FISHER: ... from the Central School of Speech and Drama that I never graduated from . @!KOTB: OK. @!FISHER: Because she wanted class in the family . @!KOTB: Yeah . @!FISHER: So she honestly thought I was going to be called Dr. Fisher , you know , and write prescriptions and stuff . And I said to her , ' Why -- please tell me why I 'm doing this again . ' @!KOTB: Yeah . @!FISHER: She said , ' It 's for your future . When is that going to happen ? I thought that was sort of already going on in a big way . So -- you know -- but now I have officially turned into my mother . @!KOTB: Yeah . @!FISHER: In our family , to turn into one another we do nightclub acts . Or -- well , mine 's not a nightclub necessarily . @!KOTB: Yeah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @!KOTB: Yeah , you do . Now what 's -- you 're going to be in Baltimore coming up , right , is that ... @!FISHER: I 'm going to be in Baltimore . @!KOTB: On January the 21 -- 31st. @!FISHER: Nude . @!KOTB: You 're not going to be nude . @!FISHER: No , I 'm not . I promise not to be nude if you come . @!KOTB: Uh-huh . @!FISHER: So please , spare all of us from that horrible thing . @!KOTB: OK . So that 's at the -- where you going to be ? Baltimore . @!FISHER: The Hippodrome. @!KOTB: Hippodrome. @!FISHER: There you go . @!KOTB: Hippodrome . All right . Do n't forget . And you 've got other dates . You 're going to be in Dayton and in Houston and we 're going to have all that stuff on our website or carriefisher.com . We promise . @!FISHER: All right . We are ? Oh , all right . There we go . @!KOTB: All right . So Demi Moore , you guys know , was in the hospital and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and she 's obviously had a really difficult time . And we ... @!FISHER: Well , not that it 's easy for anybody , but ... @!KOTB: Yeah . @!FISHER: ... to do it this sort of ... @!KOTB: Publicly . @!FISHER: Yes . @!KOTB: Yeah . What do you think about that ? I mean , there are two issues going on . One is that she 's obviously -- we 've all had difficult terrible times with breakups and gone through difficult situations . @!FISHER: Oh , I have n't . I 've had only good fun . @!KOTB: What was your worst breakup , by the way ? @!FISHER: Oh , it 's such a competition . No , no , actually -- no , no , it really actually is n't a competition , but I 'm not going to say . @!KOTB: Yeah . @!FISHER: Just guess . But it is difficult because -- well , especially with her , though , I mean can you believe that after this length of time they 're still saying , ' Jen breaks -- wants to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' and Brad finds a text message in her car . ' @!KOTB: Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . @!FISHER: You know , it 's -- so this , I think , was -- it just looked -- they were just watching her waiting , it seems like ... @!KOTB: For something . @!FISHER: ... for something to happen , so she ... @!KOTB: What about these -- you know , we see May-December romances with men all the time , the older man and the younger woman , and now we 're seeing a lot more of the reverse . @!FISHER: Not a lot more . But when a man does it , it 's , ' Hey , nice one . ' @!KOTB: ' Hey , cool guy . Yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah . @!FISHER: But when a woman does it , it 's , ' Have him washed and brought to my tent . ' @!KOTB: Yeah . @!FISHER: You know , it 's -- so -- which actually is a line of Cher's. @!KOTB: Uh-huh . @!FISHER: Just like to give credit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's more -- it 's embarrassing . @!KOTB: Yeah . Is -- it ... @!FISHER: I mean , it 's viewed that way -- or the inevitable . When they break up ... @!KOTB: Yeah . @!FISHER: ... then they , ' Oh , come on . ' @!KOTB: Right . Because Madonna does it , J.Lo does it , there are a lot of people who have -- Cher did it . @!FISHER: Yeah , but it -- how they talk about it is not , you know , really complimentary . @!KOTB: Yeah . People -- the way people look at it . There is a new website out there -- if you do break up with your boyfriend or whatever and you wondered what went wrong , like , ' Why did we break up , but I guess you never really asked him -- what you can do ... @!FISHER: Like you care about his opinion at that point . @!KOTB: Right . @!FISHER: But OK. @!KOTB: What you can do later -- apparently there 's a website where ... @!FISHER: How much later ? @!KOTB: When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When ... @!KOTB: You can write him a letter on this website , wot -- W-O-T -- wentwrong , and you can ask him in a form letter to ask to tell you what went wrong . @!FISHER: Like give a resume like for the next boyfriend ? @!KOTB: Yeah . Yeah , so you can figure out ... @!FISHER: ' She 's really bad before 10 AM. ' @!KOTB: Yeah . @!FISHER: ' And not really a great cook . And she takes things way too ' -- I mean what ... @!KOTB: Here -- OK. @!FISHER: Another way to be mean to people ... @!KOTB: To -- yes . @!FISHER: ... on the Internet. @!KOTB: OK , let me ask you this . If you could line up all your previous relationships , OK , pretend , for a second , there they all are in a line . @!FISHER: OK . Oh . @!KOTB: And you could ask them all what was the reason -- if you had to boil it down to one reason that this relationship did n't work , what was the -- what would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guys would say ? Why -- what would the common thread be , do you think ? @!FISHER: She 's a lot . @!KOTB: She 's a lot ? @!FISHER: Yeah . It 's -- you know ... @!KOTB: What does that mean ? @!FISHER: I think they would say that I was , you know , not sort of someone who can be found in the ... @!KOTB: Easy ? @!FISHER: No. @!KOTB: Yeah . @!FISHER: Just , you know , too much . @!KOTB: Complicated . @!FISHER: Oh , yeah , and I 'm not -- I 'm not a typical wife . @!KOTB: Yeah . @!FISHER: So I mean , if you look at me and think , ' Oh , that 's my girlfriend , maybe that flies . ' @!KOTB: Yeah . Yeah . @!FISHER: But if you look at me and say , ' This is my wife , it looks weirder. @!KOTB: Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . @!FISHER: So I do n't know . I do n't mean to brag . But I just -- I think that might come up on the resume . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @!FISHER: Thousands of them . @!KOTB: Did you ? @!FISHER: One after another . I have . @!KOTB: What was the youngest you ever went in terms of an age gap ? @!FISHER: Twelve . And I got arrested . And so I learned from that . @!KOTB: Yeah . @!FISHER: More than necessary . @!KOTB: Yeah . @!FISHER: And it was -- and it 's embarrassing . @!KOTB: Is it ? @!FISHER: Well ... @!KOTB: Yeah . @!FISHER: With -- when you get around other people ... @!KOTB: Yeah . @!FISHER: Yes . I went out with one who -- and he was in very good shape and that was kind of his focus , so on Christmas he gave me an exercise bike and I gave him some books . So that did n't ... @!KOTB: Yeah . That 's -- and there it is. @!FISHER: Yeah , it kind of spoke of -- yes . @!KOTB: Yeah . Of all the guys , the love of your life , who was -- who was the love of your life of the men you were with ? @!FISHER: Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @!KOTB: Is there one ? @!FISHER: You know , in different ways . @!KOTB: Yeah . @!FISHER: I -- Paul was ... @!KOTB: Paul Simon , yeah . @!FISHER: ... you know , very -- he was very -- he 's a great artist ... @!KOTB: Mm-hmm . @!FISHER: ... so that was great , too . @!KOTB: Mm-hmm . @!FISHER: And I was quite young ... @!KOTB: Mm-hmm . @!FISHER: ... and so it was like being apprenticed to someone who was brilliant . @!KOTB: Mm-hmm . @!FISHER: And then my daughter 's father ... @!KOTB: Mm-hmm . @!FISHER: ... he took good care of me. @!KOTB: Who was he ? Who 's your daughter 's father ? @!FISHER: I do n't know . I 'm still going through the tests . No , his name is Bryan Lord . @!KOTB: Uh-huh . @!FISHER: And he 's an agent . @!KOTB: Uh-huh . @!FISHER: And I 'm -- and he 's a great father . And we tried very hard and succeeded -- and we 'd go on vacations together . @!KOTB: Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . @!FISHER: You know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , OK . That can happen . @!FISHER: Who does n't ? @!KOTB: Who does n't ? Right , who does n't ? @!FISHER: Yeah . @!KOTB: Real quick , I want to get to -- do we have time to do the playlist or should we skip ? We 'll do it real quick . Here 's a little Michael Jackson song . Every Thursday I do a playlist . And I thought -- you were close with Michael , and this is an old -- this is one of his old songs . It 's kind of a good dance song . So if you 're on the treadmill and you get on that bike that guy gave you ... @!FISHER: Elliptical . @!KOTB: Elliptical . @!FISHER: OK. @!KOTB: All right . @!FISHER: Yes . @!KOTB: Here it is . What 's the song ? Come on , it -- do you like to dance ? @!FISHER: Well , not in public . @!KOTB: Really ? @!FISHER: Am I going to have to do this with you ? @!KOTB: No . No , just -- you can feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little bit of it . Do you like it ? @!FISHER: No. @!KOTB: She hates it . Coming up next , you guys , actor Luke Perry 's in the house . We 're going to talk to him about his newest film out on the Hallmark Channel . Very good-looking guy . @!FISHER: Very good-looking . @!KOTB: We 'll talk to him right after this . ' 
##4103532 @!GUTHRIE reporting : And now to TODAY 'S PROFESSIONALS , our panel of power players weighing in on the hot topics of today . Star Jones is an attorney and author , Donny Deutsch is chairman of advertising giant Deutsch Incorporated and a trouble maker . @!Ms-STAR-JONES-@1At: Always . @!GUTHRIE: And Dr. Nancy Snyderman is NBC 's chief medical editor . Good morning all of you . @!Ms-JONES: Hey . Hey , Natalie . @!Mr-DONNY-DEUTSCH-@: @(Unintelligible) ... power players . @!Dr-NANCY-@: Hi , Savannah . @!Mr-DONNY-DEUTSCH: What do we really mean by that ? @!GUTHRIE: I do n't know . I 've been asking myself that question for approximately six months now when the segment started . @!SNYDERMAN: Exactly . @!GUTHRIE: Hey , let 's get to -- we 'll start with Demi Moore . She 's been hospitalized , her rep says for exhaustion and to take care of her overall health . There have been reports of a seizure . There have been reports of prescription drug use . I guess , first , knowing as little about it as we do officially , Nancy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we know is what we 've seen , that she 's become phenomenally thin and distraught , and I think it 's very hard for these guys to live a very public life in a microcosm . She looks , I feel , I mean , I think it 's a profoundly sad story . Probably prescription drugs . The seizure could easily make sense if there were electrolyte abnormalities , or drug-drug interactions . All we know is that she 's hospitalized . The words they 've tossed out are Hollywood code words for real problems ... @!Ms-JONES: Right . @!SNYDERMAN: ... and huge psychiatric issue . @!GUTHRIE: Like exhaustion . @!Mr-DEUTSCH: You know what , it 's got to be challenging for somebody like her . And I 'm going to generalize here , but you take a Meryl Streep , actresses who did n't build their craft , reputation on their beauty . And coincidentally -- not that she 's not a beautiful woman -- they stay strong . How many actresses like ... @!SNYDERMAN: She also left Hollywood . @!Mr-DEUTSCH: But let me -- like Demi , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but beautiful , gorgeous . And as they sort of hit a certain age , unfortunately , it 's not fair , Hollywood turns their back to some degree . And this is just a sad , harsh fact . And I just wonder if you trace how many young , beautiful actresses ... @!GUTHRIE: Is that ... @(unintelligible) ... @!Mr-DEUTSCH: ... that in some way they kind of crash because they 're loosing ... @!GUTHRIE: You 're saying it 's Hollywood , not the fact that she 's going through a painful divorce . @!Ms-JONES: It happens in life . It happens in life . @!Mr-DEUTSCH: I think that 's a -- that 's a ... @!Ms-JONES: It happens in life . When you are a 40-something woman -- we 're the exact same age -- and you have to imagine that her marriage is breaking up , all of her friends are looking at her , ' Do you need anything ? Do you want anything ? She 's feeling a little down and depressed -- or a lot down and depressed . Her man is over in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's upset . I can understand . @!Mr-DEUTSCH: But this is symbolic . Also the career -- OK , a young guy that was into her , he moves on . He 's supposed to be a real jerk , by the way . I 've never met him , but I 've never heard a good thing . I mean , that 's just what I 've heard about him . @!SNYDERMAN: But , you know , the problem is this love-hate relationship that women have with their bodies . And when you market yourself as being sort of the physical dependency of how you are perceived , and then guess what , I do n't care how old you are , gravity sets in and the aging the phenomena is huge . @!Mr-DEUTSCH: They want sexy -- they want sexy ... @!GUTHRIE: OK . You know what ? I 'll ... @!Mr-DEUTSCH: One sexy ... @!GUTHRIE: I hear you all on this on Hollywood and age . @!SNYDERMAN: Helen Mirren. @!GUTHRIE: But Demi Moore is an example of somebody who looks fantastic for any age . @!SNYDERMAN: Correct . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ role in a movie ? @!GUTHRIE: Well , that 's separate . You think it 's a career problem ? @!Mr-DEUTSCH: But it 's not . I think that if the two are linked . I mean in her ... @!SNYDERMAN: But you 're ... @!Mr-DEUTSCH: ... listen to me . If you 're a woman and your man leaves you or visa versa , obviously you start to ... @!SNYDERMAN: But what Savannah said is really important . We perceive her as beautiful . She may not perceive herself as beautiful . @!Mr-DEUTSCH: Well , that 's my point . That 's my point . @!Ms-JONES: That 's really what the big -- her point in a recent article was , ' I 'm not sure if I 'm someone that can be loved . That 's some real deep serious stuff that she 's dealing with on her own that ... @!GUTHRIE: Yeah . @!Ms-JONES: ... that has to do with , ' I 'm getting older . This young guy that I was in love with does n't love me that way anymore . I 'm -- reality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's saying . @!GUTHRIE: Well , let 's move on . But I think we 're all sympathetic to where she finds herself . @!SNYDERMAN: And , boy , do we wish her the best . @!Ms-JONES: Absolutely . @!SNYDERMAN: She 's got a big hurdle . @!Mr-DEUTSCH: I hope she 's OK. @!GUTHRIE: We 'll take a turn . Starbucks , famed coffee chain , is starting to test out serving alcohol . It 's actually going to -- they did this in a pilot program and now it 's going to do it about 25 locations . Do we think this is a good idea ? @!Ms-JONES: Savannah , I 'm the consumer that they 're marketing to because I 've never gone to a Starbucks . I do n't drink coffee . @!SNYDERMAN: Never ? @!Ms-JONES: No . I do n't drink coffee . I think I 've gone in to use the Internet for a couple of seconds . @!SNYDERMAN: They hate people like you . @!Ms-JONES: That 's exactly right . I 'm the consumer they 're marketing to . I do n't drink coffee . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money for a cup of coffee . So I would be the one that would meet my girlfriend for a glass of wine at the end of the day . @!GUTHRIE: You 'd go to Starbucks ? But let 's ask Donny , our brand expert . @!Mr-DEUTSCH: I have a concern . Yeah , I -- and Howard Schultz who runs Starbucks is a brilliant guy . I have a question as far as what this does for the brand . To me it 's all about ... ( network audio difficulties ) ... of all ages . All of a sudden you 're serving alcohol , particularly if you start to serve alcohol early in the day , or you start to , you know -- you do n't go into places in this country at 10 AM where they serve alcohol . Now if it 's there -- so if they 're doing it , I would advise them do if after 4 PM. @!GUTHRIE: But I think that is the plan . @!Mr-DEUTSCH: But I ... @!Ms-JONES: Yes . I think that is the plan , yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But I have a big issue with it though . I think it changes the brand . @!SNYDERMAN: Well , I think Starbucks .... @!Mr-DEUTSCH: And it 's going to bring in a different kind of people . I think -- and he 's a brilliant marketer , Schultz , but I think it 's a mistake . I really do . @!SNYDERMAN: I like him a lot because he provides health care to all of his employees . @!Mr-DEUTSCH: Great guy . Great guy . @!SNYDERMAN: And he 's just a great big thinker . The problem is Starbucks once upon a time stopped smelling like coffee beans when you walked in . At that point , it stopped being a coffee house and became something else . My concern is that people will pick up some booze and pick up some coffee and think they can get hammered and the coffee will make them sober . And those -- it just does n't work . @!Mr-DEUTSCH: Rule -- also , rule number one of marketing , you ca n't be all things to all people . @!GUTHRIE: Yeah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , and it 's a mistake . @!GUTHRIE: And ... @(unintelligible) ... @!SNYDERMAN: Plus , Savannah ... @!GUTHRIE: ... really likes to go to Starbucks to write , you know , their screenplay . You ca n't do that when you 're drunk or it wo n't be any good at all . @!Ms-JONES: Oh , actually you could . @!GUTHRIE: OK , let 's move on . You 'll love this one , Donny . Is sexting attractive ? OK , a dating expert has now gone on the record saying that sexting can be a good thing . He says the best seduction technique for a guy is to get the girl to start thinking about him in a sexy way hours before they have plans to see each other . And the majority of people on The Huffington Post survey thought it was a good idea . @!Mr-DEUTSCH: I would like to wage a complaint with NBC that whenever there is some type of you know , salacious topic , you start with me. @!GUTHRIE: Yeah . @!Mr-DEUTSCH: And I think you 're objectifying me . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oh , you think we started that ? @!Mr-DEUTSCH: And I 'm very upset . Wait , my pants are vibrating. @!Ms-JONES: It 's called exhibit A. @!Mr-DEUTSCH: I actually think -- my pants are vibrating , bad statement . @!GUTHRIE: That already disqualifies you . @!Ms-JONES: OK , yeah . @!Mr-DEUTSCH: I actually think -- I think sexting is a fun , seductive thing . I think it is using this device in a fun way . The problem I think for young people though is they often will do things that they would n't ordinarily do in -- with actual words and they tend to be more open or more overt than they 're comfortable doing it . @!Ms-JONES: Donny , young people ? Are you out of your mind ? Kwame Kilpatrick , the former mayor of Detroit , went to jail , prison because of sexting . OK ? @!Mr-DEUTSCH: But there 's a difference between illegal sexting ... @!GUTHRIE: Need I mention Anthony Weiner ? @!Ms-JONES: No , no , no . It was n't illegal . No , no , no. @!SNYDERMAN: I was just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't illegal . Yes , it was n't illegal . @!Mr-DEUTSCH: OK , guys , but there -- there 's a big difference between some guy showing his wiener and a guy who just is a cute with women back and forth . @!Ms-JONES: No , you 're not -- you 're not -- you 're not listening . @!SNYDERMAN: It 's a gray line . @!Ms-JONES: The man -- listen , this is the one thing that makes ... @!Mr-DEUTSCH: These congressmen are awful . @!Ms-JONES: This is the one thing that makes me crazy . I 'm a lawyer . Be smart . Do n't put that stuff in paper . That lives there forever . @!GUTHRIE: OK . Wait , wait , wait . @!Mr-DEUTSCH: Guys , you 're missing the point . There 's nothing -- nobody said -- there 's no legalities . The issue is , is it inappropriate , is it seductive , is it fun ? And I think . .. @!SNYDERMAN: So what you 're basically saying ... @!GUTHRIE: OK. @!SNYDERMAN: ... is that when women sex text you , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happened to me , but if it ever did -- if it ever did happen , I would ... @!SNYDERMAN: Oh , you 're lying now @!GUTHRIE: Despite all your solicitations. @!Mr-DEUTSCH: I -- it 's never happened . @!GUTHRIE: I think , setting aside these ... @!Mr-DEUTSCH: And by the way , this is a -- this is a formal ask , OK . My telephone number -- no I 'm kidding . @!GUTHRIE: No , no. @!Ms-JONES: Donny said he liked it . @!GUTHRIE: Setting aside the issues like an Anthony Weiner or a Kwame Kilpatrick who got in trouble for it , because there 's probably a spectrum of what 's appropriate . @!Mr-DEUTSCH: Of course . @!GUTHRIE: The larger issue is , if it 's sort of a playful text , is that something that would be appealing to the two women on this panel ? @!Ms-JONES: Savannah , what I ... @!Mr-DEUTSCH: What 's wrong with that ? @!Ms-JONES: Savannah , what I 'm -- wait , wait , wait . Savannah , what I 'm ... @!SNYDERMAN: The answer is -- the reality is ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is a barrier and allows you to sort of be a little more flirtatious than if you were being face to face . @!Ms-JONES: May I give you the other side , please ? I think . .. @!SNYDERMAN: Is it dangerous ? Yes . But it 's sexy . @!Mr-DEUTSCH: What 's the other side . @!Ms-JONES: The other is it takes away some of the intimacy of having the person right there care enough to say to you , ' I ... ' @!SNYDERMAN: No , you 're wrong . @!Mr-DEUTSCH: It 's not either or . @!Ms-JONES: Excuse me , I 'm not wrong . It could be your opinion or my opinion , but I 'm not wrong . All right ? @!Mr-DEUTSCH: You 're wrong . @!Ms-JONES: No , I 'm not wrong . @!GUTHRIE: You 're not going to get a sexting text later and you all are n't going to be sexting each other . OK. @!Ms-JONES: No . I would like to have a conversation rather than a text message . If you want me , say , ' I 'd like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my face . @!SNYDERMAN: I 'm sorry . That 's sexting. @!Ms-JONES: OK . No , it 's talking . @!GUTHRIE: OK. @!Ms-JONES: God forbid we should talk . @!GUTHRIE: Let 's move on to another sex topic for Donny . Cuddle or sleep ? OK . A recent study by evolutionary psychologists found that people whose partners fell asleep immediately after sex were more likely to want to cuddle and chitchat . That was the first part of it . So if you were -- if you were likely -- if your partner was likely to fall asleep , you were probably the person who wanted to cuddle more . And it gets rid of the stereotype , it is not more common for men to fall asleep before women after sex . We can put an end to that stereotype . @!Mr-DEUTSCH: I do n't -- I do n't understand the question . @!GUTHRIE: Yeah , well basically , so if you want -- if your partner is more likely to fall asleep first , then apparently you are wanting to cuddle . Which kind of makes sense . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question I 'd like to ask you guys , right after sex ... @!Ms-JONES: Oh , yeah . @!SNYDERMAN: Yeah ? @!Mr-DEUTSCH: ... do you think normally people -- OK , kind of do their thing , clean themselves up and come back or is there the old-school ... @!SNYDERMAN: Clean themselves up ? @!Ms-JONES: You know what it is ? @!SNYDERMAN: What are you ... @!GUTHRIE: Donny ... @!Mr-DEUTSCH: No. @!Ms-JONES: The problem is is you 've got to stop having all that honey and stuff all over the place . @!Mr-DEUTSCH: People do n't sit there and just -- people do n't just hang right after sex . They go -- then they come back and ... @!Ms-JONES: Yeah , they do . They do . @!Mr-DEUTSCH: That 's my problem . @!Ms-JONES: They do . They kind of just hang . @!SNYDERMAN: Geez , oh man . @!Ms-JONES: When you ... @!GUTHRIE: My , God . This has really deteriorated . @!Ms-JONES: Excuse me , when you have sex with someone other than someone you have pay , then you hang . OK. @!Mr-DEUTSCH: I ... @!Ms-JONES: Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . @!GUTHRIE: OK , and that 's our queue . Star Jones , Donny Deutsch , Dr. Nancy . @!SNYDERMAN: There 's a strong ... @!Mr-DEUTSCH: Savannah , I think we 're drifting . @!GUTHRIE: I do , too . @!Mr-DEUTSCH: You and I , we need to -- we 've lost it here . @!GUTHRIE: We -- but we need to more this , but but let 's go to a commercial . @!Ms-JONES: I know . @!GUTHRIE: Thanks , guys . See you again . @!Ms-JONES: All right . @!GUTHRIE: Coming up next , is mommy stress hurting your family and your health ? We 're going to tell you how to recognize the signs that you need a mommy time-out . Also ahead , women of a certain age are certainly beautiful , confident and sexy . Ninety-year-old Betty White is certainly an example of that . Coming up , we 're going to meet four everyday women who are going to share their age-defying style secrets , coming up after these messages . @!Ms-JONES: She looks great . ' 
##4103533 @!GIFFORD , co-host : January 25th , and we 're just two weeks away and a day from our big trip to the Bahamas . Just thinking about the ocean breeze . @!HODA-KOTB-co-host: Hm. @!GIFFORD: Not bad . @!KOTB: I hope everyone comes out to see us . Again , come on Thursday . It 's the 9th , right ? @!GIFFORD: Pack your thongs ... @!KOTB: Yes . @!GIFFORD: ... and come see us. @!KOTB: Because here 's the reason that you should come . January is not generally a great month , according to one of these surveys , and this is the deal . They say that most couple when they split up , split up in the month of January . @!GIFFORD: Because ... @!KOTB: Well ... @!GIFFORD: ... it 's a letdown from ... @(Neil-Sedaka's- " Bre @!GIFFORD: Who let Neil Sedaka in ? I love Neil Sedaka. @!KOTB: OK , here 's the deal . You have a ton of Christmas bills , you 're overwhelmed with debt , there 's nothing to look forward to . It 's cold . @!GIFFORD: @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terrible . @!GIFFORD: I just did . I had a piece of cheese . @!KOTB: Oh , yeah , that was yours . @!GIFFORD: That was me . I know I 'm not supposed to have cheese . I had the cheese , thank you . @!KOTB: Anyway , they say that the average couple in Britain -- why do we care about what they 're doing -- they argue eight minutes ... @!GIFFORD: They are one of our strongest allies politically . @!KOTB: ... out of the -- yeah , but anyway , they spend eight minutes out of their 24-hour day arguing in the month of January . @!GIFFORD: About what ? If they know that it 's eight minutes would n't you think that they 'd also know what it 's about ? ' I want to get my teeth fixed . ' No , I think your teeth look good . I mean , is that what they argue about ? Austin Powers . @!KOTB: Anyway , they say it 's a bad month . So you -- so knowing that that 's the case you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can divorce or get out of town and ... @!KOTB: No , you can -- you can -- sometimes , you know what , some couples have the same arguments , most do ... @!GIFFORD and @!KOTB: ( In unison ) Over and over and over . @!GIFFORD: That 's right . @!KOTB: And the good news is , is once you see it coming ... @!GIFFORD: Yeah . @!KOTB: ... you know , here 's that green monster again and you know it 's going to go away . And it 's just going to keep happening forever . @!GIFFORD: Frank and I have been married for so long that when we sense it coming , one of us just gets up and leaves the room . You know , it 's because we know where it 's going , it 'll never be settled . Sayonara , see you at dinner . You know ? @!KOTB: Yeah . @!GIFFORD: I mean ... @!KOTB: Sometimes it 's better . @!GIFFORD: It really is . I mean ... @!KOTB: You guys ... @!GIFFORD: ... he 's never going to change , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other anyway so just ... @!KOTB: But some people are real arguers . I mean , when they argue they are full-blown ... @!GIFFORD: Yeah . @!KOTB: ... yelling , screaming arguers. @!GIFFORD: Yeah , I do n't like to live my life that way . @!KOTB: No , no. @!GIFFORD: I love to watch other people do it , though . No , I do n't . That 's why I ca n't stand these reality shows when people are just so rude to one another and screaming and you have to bleep out every other word . @!KOTB: I do n't really -- yeah . I do n't really think most people talk like that . @!GIFFORD: It 's like watching " Parenthood . " Ba-dum-bum. @!GIFFORD and @!KOTB: ( In unison ) Just kidding . @!KOTB: Hey , we have Monica Potter from " Parenthood . " @!GIFFORD: It 's the exact opposite of watching " Parenthood . " @!KOTB: All right , so here 's the deal . If you 're wondering what the rudest cities in America are and whether or not you live in one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ America . Number five , according to them , not us , is Boston , number four ... @!GIFFORD: Never experienced it there . @!KOTB: ... Los Angeles . @!GIFFORD: No. @!KOTB: Three , rudeness , Washington , DC. @!GIFFORD: I do n't think so . @!KOTB: Two , Miami . @!GIFFORD: Maybe . @!KOTB: And number one , the rudest city in America is New York . @!GIFFORD: Big surprise . @!KOTB: Come on ! I disagree . @!GIFFORD: I find people in Miami very -- just very friendly . @!KOTB: I -- and I actually find people in New York once -- I mean , it took a little bit of adjusting when I first moved here , but I do n't think -- I do n't think it 's rude . I think it 's just there 's a tone in which people speak . If you just listen to what they 're saying sometimes and not how they 're saying it . @!GIFFORD: Yeah . @!KOTB: Because I used to think all the cab drivers were yelling at me . Like , ' Where are you going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are you going ' ? I was like ' Oh , my God , I 'm going to the West Side , like I would have that feeling . @!GIFFORD: Yeah . @!KOTB: But now I just realize ... @!GIFFORD: You should just yell back . Yeah . @!KOTB: Yeah . Here are the friendliest . You may live in one of these . Number five is Charleston . @!GIFFORD: Beautiful . @!KOTB: South Carolina . Number four Savannah , Georgia . @!GIFFORD: Notice these are all Southern , mm-hmm . @!KOTB: Listen to this , number three , Nashville , one of the most beautiful cities . @!GIFFORD: Great , great city . @!KOTB: I love that . San Juan , Puerto Rico . @!GIFFORD: They 're all in the South , Hoda woman . @!KOTB: And the number one city is New Orleans . @!GIFFORD: Yeah . They 're the nicest , sweetest people in the world . Yep , yep . @!KOTB: All right . All right , these kind -- these kind of videos always crack people up . This is another one of those viral videos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's the -- it 's the story of a little baby whose father is asking this child whether he loves the father or the mother more . Anyway , just take a listen . @(Clip-from-Internet @!GIFFORD: Do n't you love how she gets quiet when he 's talking . Oh , it 's precious . @!KOTB: Da-da . Oh ! Four million hits . @!GIFFORD: Did you have a favorite parent ? This is touchy for us because ... @!KOTB: No. @!GIFFORD: ... both of us have lost our fathers and our mothers are watching . @!KOTB: I do n't -- yeah . No , and you know what ? I do n't -- you know , honestly , I was probably closer with my mom . @!GIFFORD: Really ? @!KOTB: Yeah , yeah , and you with your dad , probably . @!GIFFORD: Probably . But I 'm very close to my mom now . All right . @!KOTB: Especially this minute . I love my mom , she 's hysterical . She 's still getting accolades . I think she truly believes she 's going to get offered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she filled in , and , by the way , I have to point out that my mother was like , ' What about me ? ' @!GIFFORD: I wondered -- I wondered if that was going to create a little trouble in Egypt . @!KOTB: Yeah , it 's time to get her in. @!GIFFORD: She 'd be awesome . @!KOTB: All right . @!GIFFORD: OK , I disagree with this yet another study . @!KOTB: OK , there 's a study that says teens who talk back to their parents -- teens who talk back may have a brighter future . @!GIFFORD: Not in your home , but someplace else . @!KOTB: Anyway , they say it 's a natural part of development to have , you know , those kinds of little tangles with your parents . @!GIFFORD: Yeah . @!KOTB: And if you talk back they think that you 're reasoning something out , that you 're having -- you 're making a discussion as opposed to you telling your child do it because I said so and they say OK. @!GIFFORD: I guess it 's the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That was always -- now we say getting sassy in our house or get ... @!KOTB: Yeah . Yeah . @!GIFFORD: ... you know , a little too sassy . Yeah , I mean , anything has to be done respectfully . What we are really missing in our country today is a respect for any kind of authority at all . @!KOTB: Yeah . @!GIFFORD: And so the talk-back thing , you know -- here 's the trouble . @!KOTB: Huh . @!GIFFORD: Kids -- most parents do n't want to listen to their children . @!KOTB: Yeah . @!GIFFORD: Yeah . I had one of these with Cass the other night and we just set aside , we said we 're going to keep it nice and low , the volume . @!KOTB: Mm-hmm . @!GIFFORD: And we 're going to turn everything off , everything off ... @!KOTB: Yeah . @!GIFFORD: ... and we 're going to sit and we 're going to talk this out . @!KOTB: And you guys did ? @!GIFFORD: Because we both want the same thing ... @!KOTB: Yeah . @!GIFFORD: ... for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . @!GIFFORD: And we want the -- we want to come to a resolution of something . @!KOTB: Right . @!GIFFORD: It was -- it was great . @!KOTB: You know , I do think it 's interesting . There was this one -- I remember there were four grown women who were all CEOs ... @!GIFFORD: Ah . @!KOTB: ... of -- and -- or CEOs or something high up . @!GIFFORD: @(Unintelligible) @!KOTB: And I remember asking their parents saying to them like , ' What did you do to make these four women , they 're all CEOs ' ... @!GIFFORD: Yeah . @!KOTB: ... I said were you so tough on them , were you disciplinarians , they said this is the only thing we did differently . When my kid said , ' I have a three-speed bike and I want a 10-speed bike and the parent would say to the young girl , ' Well , why ? And if she said , ' Well , because my friends have one , everyone has them , Mom . She said , ' No , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' -- sounds weird -- ' write a proposal and give me the reasons why you think it 's a good idea . The child wrote back , ' Because when I ride back and forth to school I 'll shave five minutes off my time and I 'll be able to spend more time here . When I do X , it 'll be Y. They could reason through everything . @!GIFFORD: Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . @!KOTB: And all those kids learned that process at a really young age . And when you look at the parents they seem soft spoken and easy going but yet all their girls turned out to be real leaders . @!GIFFORD: Yes . @!KOTB: So it does n't -- I do n't know if you have to have this kind of a thing to end up having really , you know ... @!GIFFORD: Nobody gets what they want when you -- when you have that kind of a thing . @!KOTB: Yeah . @!GIFFORD: Have you ever seen that show " Sweet 16 " ? @!KOTB: Unh-uh , what is it ? @!GIFFORD: Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is it ? It 's a reality show . @!GIFFORD: If you still have any -- huh ? @!KOTB: What is it , a reality show ? @!GIFFORD: It 's a reality series ... @!KOTB: Oh . @!GIFFORD: ... about , you know , just spoiled rotten entitled kids and what they get on their 16th birthday and what they feel entitled to . @!KOTB: Gross , gross . @!GIFFORD: and how rude they are to everybody in the process . @!KOTB: Yeah . @!GIFFORD: You just -- you just want to scream . @!KOTB: Oh , no. @!GIFFORD: Yeah . @!KOTB: I ca n't -- I ca n't take it . @!GIFFORD: Yeah . @!KOTB: I ca n't -- I ca n't take listening . I just feel like there 's a new breed of kids and I do n't want to -- you do n't want to broad brush everybody , but boy , you know , when we used to intern at places we would stay till midnight if our boss asked us to . Now kids are like this , ' Hey , I 've got to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're like , ' How is this even possible ? ' @!GIFFORD: I know . @!KOTB: I find it , I do n't know , I find it bizarre . @!GIFFORD: We 're going to talk to Monica in a little bit . She 's a mom on " Parenthood " and she 's got all the answers . She does everything right . @!KOTB: Yes , she does , she does , she does , she does . @!GIFFORD: Now this bothers me , but apparently they say this is a good thing when you go uh and um . @!KOTB: Um . @!GIFFORD: You know who never does that ? @!GIFFORD and @!KOTB: ( In unison ) Richard Simmons ! @!Mr-RICHARD-SIMMONS: Hi . @!KOTB: He 's supposed to go ah . @!GIFFORD: Ah . @!KOTB: Hi , Richard . @!GIFFORD: Oh , Richard , we have n't seen you in the longest time and we love you . @!Mr-SIMMONS: I love you both .

No need for verbal fillers when Richard 's around . @!KOTB: Yeah . @!GIFFORD: OK . Let 's just get on with this show . You know , we got to leave a lot of time for everybody . @!KOTB: Yes , we certainly do . Up next , you know her as Kristina on the NBC hit show " Parenthood . " @!GIFFORD: Boy , do we like to say those words , the NBC hit show . Actress Monica Potter , she 's so pretty , right after these messages . ' 
##4103534 @!CURRY , co-host : And that hostage rescue was carried out just a short time before President Obama delivered the State of the Union address . @!MATT-LAUER-co-hos: In fact , the president appeared to have referenced the raid before his speech when he was heard saying " good job " to Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta. @!CURRY: And this morning President Obama released a statement thanking US special operation forces for their , quote , " extraordinary courage and capabilities . " We want to go straight now to NBC 's Jim Miklaszewski at the Pentagon for more on this . Mik , good morning . @!JIM-MIKLASZEWSKI-r: Good morning , Ann . Well , score another one for US special operations forces who rescued these two hostages . And remarkably , this mission was indeed still unfolding even during the president 's State of the Union speech . And it was , in fact , the president who dropped a hint that something was going down . President Obama himself tipped off the entire world to the rescue when he openly congratulated Defense Secretary Leon Panetta prior to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Good job tonight . Good job tonight . @!MIKLASZEWSKI: The president got late word that the two kidnap victims , 32-year-old American Jessica Buchanan and the 60-year-old Dane Poul Thisted had been rescued in a daring nighttime raid in Somalia . @!US-officials-tell-# And in a White House photo released just minutes ago , President Obama is seen on the telephone immediately after that State of the Union speech last night telling Jessica Buchanan 's father that his daughter had been rescued . Now , neither one of the hostages was hurt during the raid . They 're getting medical examinations in that region before heading home , bringing their harrowing three-month ordeal to a welcome end . Matt : @!LAUER: NBC 's Jim Miklaszewski , thank you very much . Joe Biden is the vice president of the United States . @!Mr-Vice-President , # Vice President JOE BIDEN : Good morning , Matt. @!LAUER: Talk to me a little bit more about this raid in Somalia to free these aid workers . How long had it been in the works . Vice Pres. BIDEN : It had been in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authorized it yesterday because the special operations forces said this was the time . Jessica 's health was beginning to decline . She 's a young woman in her 30s so we wanted to act and they did . And the president followed the recommendation . As I was leaving the White House last night when -- the Situation Room when it was actually under way and it was once again a remarkable testament to the special operations forces . These guys are absolutely incredible . @!LAUER: Did the president realize he was tipping the press off to this operation by congratulating Secretary Panetta in the moments before the State of the Union address ? Vice Pres. BIDEN : I do n't think so . I did n't ask him about it , but it was -- the answer is I do n't think so . @!LAUER: All right . Stand by , Mr. Vice President , if you will . I want to ask you about the State of the Union address in a moment . But first , I want to bring in NBC 's chief White House correspondent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good morning to you . @!CHUCK-TODD-reporti: Well , good morning , Matt . You know , the president 's State of the Union address was not a campaign speech per se , but his populist rhetoric is something we 're going to hear a lot of in the general election campaign ahead . President Obama used this election year State of the Union address to talk about the future and boast about what he believes are his best accomplishments. @!Pres-OBAMA: The state of our union is getting stronger . And we 've come too far to turn back now . @!TODD: Bracing for a tough re-election fight , an upbeat president struck a decidedly populist tone . @!Pres-OBAMA: Where we can restore an economy where everyone gets a fair shot and everyone does their fair share and everyone plays by the same set of rules . @!TODD: He also went out of his way to strike a patriotic tone using the words " America " and " American " 88 times . @!Pres-OBAMA: What 's at stake are n't Democratic values , or Republican values , but American values . American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And sticking to that populist theme he went after a couple of easy targets , Wall Street and Congress . @!Pres-OBAMA: I 've talked tonight about the deficit of trust between Main Street and Wall Street . But the divide between this city and the rest of the country is at least as bad . @!TODD: Foreign policy mostly took a back seat but there was one topic that came up twice . @!Pres-OBAMA: For the first time in two decades , Osama bin Laden is not a threat to this country . @!TODD: The president going out of his way to use the successful bin Laden mission as a lesson on how Washington should work . @!Pres-OBAMA: You know , one of my proudest possessions is the flag that the SEAL team took with them on the mission to get bin Laden . On it are each of their names . Some may be Democrats , some may be Republicans , but that does n't matter . @!TODD: But the presidential campaign was never far from his mind . One of his signature proposals , creating a 30 percent minimum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ billionaire to pay at least as much as his secretary in taxes ? Most Americans would call that common sense . @!TODD: The president could have been talking directly to Mitt Romney who released his own tax returns Tuesday . They showed he paid less than 15 percent . Under the president 's proposal Romney 's tax bill would more than double . Former Governor MITT ROMNEY : He seems to think America 's on the right track and things are going well . @!TODD: In an interview with Brian Williams , Romney questioned the president 's optimistic tone . @!Gov-ROMNEY: People are very , very concerned , and the idea that we 're on the right track is something which is very foreign to the people here . @!TODD: But the emotional high point of the evening took place before anyone uttered a word . Arizona Congresswoman Gabby Giffords , who is officially resigning her seat today , received an enthusiastic bipartisan salute , including a special greeting from the president . Well , the president 's traditional post State of the Union travel schedule looks awfully like a campaign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days , from Michigan , Arizona , Nevada , Colorado and Iowa , Matt. @!LAUER: And let us bring back in Vice President Joe Biden. @!Mr-Vice-President , # Vice Pres. BIDEN : Well , I think the assessment -- I think they 're both accurate . It 's one thing to have a Congress that is do-nothing . Another thing is a Congress that stops everything . And we ca n't just -- we ca n't function that way and he made it clear that he wants to see that changed . And with regard to the middle class , this is what it 's all about . And we 've been talking about this from the day we got elected . And what 's fair for the middle class . And it 's fair for the middle class to have a shot at a good job , fair for the middle class who can keep their house payments up to be able to refinance , it 's fair for the middle class to be able to educate their kids . And that 's what this is about . I mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other guy , it 's about the middle class . @!LAUER: Right . Vice Pres. BIDEN : What should we be doing to help them ? @!LAUER: On the subject of taxes , he wants the so-called Buffett rule . He wants millionaires and billionaires to pay at least 30 percent of their income in taxes . He says you can call it class warfare , Americans think it 's fair . He also admitted he ca n't get it done this year . Why should we believe if he 's re-elected and the Republicans retain control of the House that he could get it done then ? Vice Pres. BIDEN : Because the American people are making it clear . Look , it 's the same reason -- I think you -- I may be mistaken , Matt , but I think you and I talked about at the end of last year , calendar year , about the payroll tax and how the Republicans were never going to do it . They were n't -- they just were n't going to do it . Well , guess what ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We did n't change their mind . What happened is not only did the American public change their mind , their own folks , the Wall Street Journal , the people said , ' Whoa , whoa , what are you guys doing ? What are you guys doing ? And , look , I still think there 's a center of the Republican Party , particularly their leadership , that is going to be able to begin to regain control of this sort of -- the element of the Republican Party in the House that just does n't want to do anything . @!LAUER: He ... Vice Pres. BIDEN : The American people are n't going to put up with this . We 're putting -- we want to bring job -- we 've got to incentivize people to bring jobs back and they 're saying they 're willing to . And these guys are n't going to act . I just think you 're going to be -- we 'll all be surprised ... @!LAUER: You talk about the American people ... Vice Pres. BIDEN : ... at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the American public . On a couple of occasions during the speech the president said the Americans feel nothing will get done in Congress this year because of deep division , and of course , it 's a political year , and maybe not next year and maybe not the year after that . But in 2008 did n't candidate Barack Obama run on the idea that he could fix Washington and change the status quo ? If by his own admission he has n't accomplished that , why should we give him another chance ? Vice Pres. BIDEN : What we should do is get rid of folks in the Congress who are preventing that from happening . In the first year the president , what did he do , he came in , he came in and he immediately passed the Recovery Act , he immediately passed the health care bill , he immediately put people -- started putting people back to work , he immediately put us in a position where we created for 23 months in a row of creating jobs . And then what happened ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along came Jones , " then along came the tea party , then along came the 87 members of the House who said , ' We 're not going to do anything . And you saw the Republican leadership try to do it . I was -- I was part of those negotiations . We shook hands a couple times and the leaders came back and said , ' Hey , Joe , sorry , we ca n't get it done . So it 's about deciding to clear away folks who in fact are obstructionists . Not the opposition ... @!LAUER: Right . Vice Pres. BIDEN : ... but obstructionists. @!LAUER: Let me turn real quickly to the upcoming campaign . On the Republican side it seems to be boiling down to a battle between Mitt Romney and Newt Gingrich , with apologies to Rick Santorum . I 'm sure he would have something to say about that . They are now trading shots at each other . Newt Gingrich on Mitt Romney 's days as a venture capitalist . And Mitt Romney seems to be attacking Newt Gingrich 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was in the House . Do you believe he has -- and by the way he 'll be joining us next -- do you believe he has the temperament to be president of the United States ? Vice Pres. BIDEN : I do n't know about -- I think Newt 's a fine guy . I just think his policies are a big mistake for the United States . I think they 'll take us back to the economic policies of the last administration , you know , unloose Wall Street , all those , you know , all the stuff you 're hearing . But I like Newt . I think Newt 's a good guy . @!LAUER: So you do n't think there 's a temperament issue . Vice Pres. BIDEN : I just fundamentally disagree with him . No , I 'm not go -- look , I do n't have a dog in this fight . I have enough trouble ... @!LAUER: You may soon have a dog in this fight . Vice Pres. BIDEN : ... you know , in the past -- no , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but we 'll know who all of us dogs are at that time . But I 'll let the Republicans sort out who 's going to run against us. @!LAUER: Vice President Joe Biden . Mr. Biden , it 's nice to see you . Thanks very much . Vice Pres. BIDEN : Good to see you , Matt . Thank you . @!LAUER: All right , and now here 's Ann . ANN @!CURRY , co-host : Matt , thank you . ' 
##4103535 @!KOTB , co-host : Everything kind of stops around 8:35 , 8:36 ... @!KATHIE-LEE-GIFFORD: Mm-hmm . @!KOTB: ... when they make the big announcement for the -- for the Oscars . And I can only imagine if you 're somebody who either made a movie or is in a movie how agonizing that must be watching those names pop up , baby . @!GIFFORD: And yet you always hear a lot of people say , ' I was asleep . My phone rang . ' @!KOTB: You know ... @!GIFFORD: Liar ! @!KOTB: ... that is not true . Can I tell you one of the big shockers to everybody on this deal ? I mean , we 're going to go through all the names , but how about Melissa McCarthy for " Bridesmaids " ? @!GIFFORD: Best Supporting Actress nomination . @!KOTB: Do you remember what she did in that movie ? @!GIFFORD: Yes , I do . @!KOTB: She did all kinds of wacky things , if you remember . There was a scene of her on the sink . Do you remember ? @!GIFFORD: @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is. @!GIFFORD: ... she was having a rough night . @!KOTB: I think that 's Oscar-worthy . By the way , she 's very , very , very funny . @!GIFFORD: She 's very funny . @!KOTB: Everybody loves her who meets her , everyone . @!GIFFORD: Yes . @!KOTB: Yeah . @!GIFFORD: But it 's hardly Meryl Streep and " Iron Lady , " right ? @!KOTB: Yeah . @!GIFFORD: Although they 're not in the same category , so she may win . @!KOTB: You never know . @!GIFFORD: You know what , everybody agrees that comedy 's much more difficult to do than the drama . @!KOTB: I was also really happy for another , at least it seemed like a surprise , Jonah Hill getting ... @!GIFFORD: Yeah , I just saw that on Sunday -- Saturday . @!KOTB: ... Best Supporting Actor -- yeah -- for " Moneyball. " @!GIFFORD: I liked -- yeah , he 's good , he 's good , he 's good . He wo n't look anything like he -- if he goes up there to make a speech , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he 's lost half his body weight , I think . @!KOTB: Oh , my gosh , does n't even look like him . And Brad Pitt did a phone interview with Matt and Ann today and he -- the first thing out of his mouth was ' I 'm so happy for Jonah Hill . ' @!GIFFORD: Yeah . @!KOTB: After all the accolades that Brad Pitt got . @!GIFFORD: Well , you know what , he 's been in the -- he 's been in the rodeo before . @!KOTB: Yeah . @!GIFFORD: And so this is Jonah 's first trip . @!KOTB: All right . @!GIFFORD: He 's a sweetheart , is n't he ? @!KOTB: He 's -- he seems so ... @!GIFFORD: He 's a really sweet kid . @!KOTB: He 's always thanking everybody else and then he gets back to his own . @!GIFFORD: Yeah . @!KOTB: Here , you guys , in case you missed it , here they are , Best Actor nominees are ... @!GIFFORD: Go ahead , Hoda. @!KOTB: Oh , I 'm waiting to see them . @!GIFFORD: @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ; George Clooney , " The Descendants " ; Jean ... @!GIFFORD: Jean Dujardin. @!KOTB: ...

" The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo . " I think the Mara family 's having an excellent week . @!KOTB: I would have to say you 're right . @!GIFFORD: Except for Mrs. Mara ... @!KOTB: Oh . @!GIFFORD: ... who fell the other day and hurt her shoulder . @!KOTB: Oh . @!GIFFORD: So our prayers are going out for her . @!KOTB: Uh-huh . @!GIFFORD: Meryl Streep , " The Iron Lady , " which you 've seen several times , Hoda woman . Michelle Williams -- I 'm dying to see this one , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -- I 've seen most of those movies -- Meryl Streep as Margaret Thatcher ... @!GIFFORD: I 'm sorry , she 's ... @!KOTB: ... like I do n't know how anyone can even touch her . @!GIFFORD: I know . @!KOTB: Because number one , you look at her and -- look at . @!GIFFORD: I know . @!KOTB: Just she is Margaret Thatcher in this movie . This is , I think , the only nomination for that movie , but ... @!GIFFORD: It 's all -- it 's all it needed . @!KOTB: Yeah . She 's great . @!GIFFORD: Yeah . And then Best Supporting Actor , Kenneth Branagh -- I love him ... @!KOTB: Mm-hmm . @!GIFFORD: ... from " My Week With Marilyn . " Jonah Hill , as we said , " Moneyball .

Right , right . @!GIFFORD: She 's been to that film three times already . @!KOTB: Mm-hmm . @!GIFFORD: And also went to the Broadway show . @!KOTB: Loved it . @!GIFFORD: She was so -- and loved it so much . So , you know , there 's an awful lot of people out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... @!KOTB: Mm-hmm . @!GIFFORD: ... beautifully sort of David Lean kind of movies ... @!KOTB: Kind of what you would expect ... @!GIFFORD: ... that Spielberg does so well . @!KOTB: Yeah , and sort of what you expect at the Oscars , something bigger than life , something , you know , something like that . @!GIFFORD: Yes . These movies are all over the place , it seems to me , in terms of their tone and their subject matter . @!KOTB: Yeah . @!GIFFORD: And that 's kind of why I like the Golden Globes in the sense that , you know , you get the comedy ... @!KOTB: Yes . @!GIFFORD: ... the musical ... @!KOTB: Yes . @!GIFFORD: ... and separate -- because you -- there 's no way you can compare " Bridesmaids " with ... @!KOTB: Yeah . @!GIFFORD: ...

What is it ? @!GIFFORD: Oscar sweet treats . @!KOTB: But what is this ? @!GIFFORD: Oh , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a drink ? @!GIFFORD: Yeah . I do n't know why we have that ... @!KOTB: Is it beer in a little tiny can ? @!GIFFORD: ... but I gratefully accept it on behalf of my party . @!KOTB: Let 's just open it . @!GIFFORD: Huh ? @!KOTB: It 's like -- is it beer or wine ? Offscreen Voice : It 's National Beer Day , but you do n't drink beer , so we 're putting it in a beer ... @!KOTB: It 's National Beer Day , but we do n't drink beer .

I 'll take care of this . You 're fine . @!KOTB: All right . OK. @!GIFFORD: Hoda 's fine . @!KOTB: Do n't worry about me . By the way -- we wo n't go there . OK .

Again , we should have had a longer production meeting . Eleni 's Oscar cookies , elenis.com. @!KOTB: Yeah . @!GIFFORD: @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On that . @!KOTB: Who ? @!GIFFORD: Three people are missing on that and they got completely snubbed by the entire thing . @!KOTB: Who ? Who ? @!GIFFORD: Clint Eastwood is missing on that for directing " J. Edgar . " @!KOTB: Oh . @!GIFFORD: Leonardo DiCaprio and Armie Hammer are both missing from ... @!KOTB: From -- " J. Edgar " got sort of shut out . @!GIFFORD: Yeah , " J. Edgar " got -- I did n't ... @!KOTB: Why ? @!GIFFORD: I do n't know . I do n't know . @!KOTB: I enjoyed ... @!GIFFORD: I enjoyed the movie very , very much . @!KOTB: Me , too . Me. too . @!GIFFORD: I found it to be fascinating . @!KOTB: Mm-hmm . @!GIFFORD: But -- you know ? And Leonardo , I 'm stunned he did n't get one . @!KOTB: I am , too . I thought he was terrific . @!GIFFORD: Yeah . @!KOTB: Now here 's what 's interesting . We talked yesterday about Heidi Klum and Seal and them splitting up , and we 're going to hear from Seal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ article in USA Today about Seal and Heidi , but more about couples that show a lot of public displays of affection . And they -- usually that looks like a great thing , you look over and you see a couple and you say , ' Wow , I wish I had that . ' @!GIFFORD: On the red carpet mostly . Yeah . @!KOTB: Yeah . Or they renew their vows . Like there 's a lot of ... @!GIFFORD: Yeah . I know . @!KOTB: ... a lot of very public love . @!GIFFORD: They had an interesting take on that , though , Hoda. @!KOTB: Yeah , they think that it 's a red flag that if there 's too much public affection you 're trying to show everybody at home or ... @!GIFFORD: Methinks thou protesteth too much kind of thing , the other way . @!KOTB: Yeah . It 's like ' Look at us together . And ... @!GIFFORD: Yeah . @!KOTB: ... so maybe that 's a red flag . I do n't know . @!GIFFORD: I do n't know , I fell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love them . @!GIFFORD: I just thought they were truly in love and perhaps -- here 's the thing , though . @!KOTB: What ? @!GIFFORD: You know , I know they carefully -- everybody carefully puts together these announcements afterwards , ' After prayerful consideration and much soul searching and much all those things ' ... @!KOTB: Mm-hmm . @!GIFFORD: ... ' we have decided that we have grown apart , you know ? @!KOTB: Yeah . @!GIFFORD: Yeah , that 's what life is , you do grow apart . @!KOTB: Yeah . Right . @!GIFFORD: That 's why when those kinds of things happen ... @!KOTB: Yeah . @!GIFFORD: ... you circle the wagons . @!KOTB: Right . @!GIFFORD: You find out what you loved about the person to begin with . @!KOTB: Mm-hmm . @!GIFFORD: You go to counseling . @!KOTB: Mm-hmm . @!GIFFORD: Especially when you have four children ... @!KOTB: Mm-hmm . @!GIFFORD: ... six children , two like I had . @!KOTB: Mm-hmm . @!GIFFORD: You have to get your eyes off ... ( points to herself ) ... @!KOTB: Yeah . @!GIFFORD: ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Right . @!GIFFORD: And I 'm not saying -- I 'm not judging their choices , I 'm just saying , you know , year after year after year we see the same thing happening , all these -- golden people and relationships breaking up all the time . @!KOTB: Mm-hmm . Yeah . @!GIFFORD: And I think there are some completely unworkable relationships and situations ... @!KOTB: Right . Some things are ... @!GIFFORD: ... totally , I was in one myself , so were you , but I think -- I would venture to say more than half of marriages that break apart could be -- could be saved . @!KOTB: Well , Seal actually spoke about -- no one has heard from either of them , you know , we 've seen , I think , a written statement , but nothing out loud until yesterday . So let 's listen to what Seal had to say . @(Clip-from- " Ellen " ) @!SEAL: Yes , I am still wearing my ring , but I think that that is just pretty much a token of how I feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You know , she -- we have -- we have eight years ... @!Ms-DeGENERES: Mm-hmm . @!SEAL: ... eight wonderful years together . @!Ms-DeGENERES: Mm-hmm . @!SEAL: And just because we have decided to separate does n't necessarily mean that , you know , you take off your ring and you 're no longer connected to that person . We will be connected in many ways to the -- to the rest of our lives , you know , through our children and also through the -- this tremendous kind of admiration and respect and love ... @!Ms-DeGENERES: Mm-hmm . @!SEAL: ... that we have for each other . Now will we wear the ring for the rest of our lives ? Who knows ? @!Ms-DeGENERES: Yeah . @!SEAL: But right now it , you know , it feels really comfortable on my hand , and so I have no intentions of taking it off any time soon . @(End-of-clip) @!KOTB: Wow . Wow . @!GIFFORD: Well , it sounds -- he 's very -- being very gentlemanly about it . @!KOTB: Mm-hmm . Yeah , sure is. @!GIFFORD: But it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have eight wonderful years together ... @!KOTB: Right . @!GIFFORD: ... then what happened ? @!KOTB: What happened ? @!GIFFORD: All of a sudden you 're ... @!KOTB: Yeah . @!GIFFORD: ... it 's not wonderful anymore ? @!KOTB: Right . @!GIFFORD: And , you know , they seem to genuinely have enormous affection for one another . @!KOTB: And respect , too . @!GIFFORD: And respect . @!KOTB: Yeah , they sure do . @!GIFFORD: And those are the -- two of the most important ingredients for a relationship . @!KOTB: You got it . All right , kids . @!GIFFORD: So ... @!KOTB: Well , to forget all of our troubles , we 're going to the Bahamas in 17 days . @!GIFFORD: Yeah . @!KOTB: We want you to come . We 're going to Atlantis . We 're going to be there February 9th and 10th , but we 're going to be doing both of our shows on February 9th . So there 's room in the audience . Slather on the sunscreen. @!GIFFORD: Yes , Hodi. @!KOTB: That 's what I was going to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's going to be a fun little trip . @!GIFFORD: It will be a lot of fun . OK . Is that all the business we have today ? @!KOTB: That 's all we got . @!GIFFORD: That 's all we got . @!KOTB: But we 've got a lucky lady with us today . @!GIFFORD: Yes . The lovely Katherine Heigl is here . She 's learned something from " The Jersey Shore . " Imagine that . Look at that . @!KOTB: How is that even possible that anyone could learn anything ? @!GIFFORD: She 's going to tell us about her new movie right after this . ' 
##4103536 @!LAUER , co-host : All right , we 've got our cheat sheets ready . It 's an early morning out in Hollywood as nominations for the 84th Academy Awards are announced . In just a moment we 're going to go live to Beverly Hills . @!ANN-CURRY-co-host: That 's right . But let 's begin with Janice Min , she 's the editor -- editorial director for the Hollywood Reporter . And she 's joining us now . Janice , good morning to you . @!Ms-JANICE-MIN-@1Ed: Good morning . @!CURRY: First of all , remind us why the Golden Globes do n't sway what we 're going to be hearing from the -- from the Academy , even though it 's been what , less than 10 days ? @!Ms-MIN: Exactly . The balloting for Oscar nominations closes about a week before the Golden Globes happen . So decisions were already made . They do n't want any other awards show influencing the Academy too much in advance . @!LAUER: And just remind our viewers who actually gets to vote for the Academy Awards . @!Ms-MIN: OK @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ random people in Hollywood . You can -- you can -- people who have won an Oscar are in the Academy . People who have had distinguished careers in film can be in the Academy . And just anyone who they feel deserves it . So it 's a pretty diverse group . But , you know , I 'll make the point , most of them are older . I think the average age is over the age of 60 . It 's a pretty conservative group . And you 'll see that probably influence some of the choices today . @!CURRY: And so they are people who really love -- in love with movies . Loving the history of the movies . @!Ms-MIN: They -- yes . @!CURRY: So would you be surprised that even though the Golden Globes do n't have sway over the Academy , if " The Artist " does n't get a nomination or two , given that it 's ... @(unintelligible) . @!Ms-MIN: I mean , that would be the bombshell of the morning if " The Artist " somehow got snubbed . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to " The Artist " vs . " Hugo , " the Martin Scorsese movie , in terms of most nominations . These are two movies that are basically love letters to Hollywood . Hollywood loves movies about Hollywood , obviously . And these two movies pay a lot of respect to the legacy . @!LAUER: Yeah , the last couple of years there have been 10 nominees for Best Picture . @!Ms-MIN: Yes . @!LAUER: We 're going to have between five and 10 this year as we get to about 30 seconds . @!CURRY: What was that about ? @!Ms-MIN: OK , it 's very confusing . But basically , they -- the Academy felt like some not great movies , some not worthy movies snuck in just to fill the quota in the last few years . @!LAUER: They 're not going to let that happen again . Not on their watch . @!Ms-MIN: Exactly , so there 's a crazy mathematical formula here where in order to be on the list , you have to be ranked number one by at least five percent of the Academy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on now . Let 's go out to the Academy , Samuel Goldwyn Theater in Beverly Hills for the nomination for the 84th Academy Awards . @!Mr-TOM-SHERAK: Hello , everybody .

And " Extremely Loud &amp; Incredibly Close , " Scott Rudin , producer . @!Mr-SHERAK: Please join us on February 26th when we celebrate the magic of the movies . Thank you . Thank you , Jennifer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So there you have it . Starting off with Best Picture , there were nine nominations . We were just talking about how there could be five to 10 there -- well , I counted nine nominations , is that what you also got ? Or maybe I got more . @!Ms-MIN: I believe I got nine as well . @!CURRY: Yeah . That 's right , " War Horse , " " Moneyball. " @!LAUER: Any surprises there ? @!Ms-MIN: Well , I think a pleasant surprise for Steven Spielberg whose " War Horse " has n't had as much awards action as he would think it would have had . It made it on the list . That 's a big deal for Spielberg . " Tree of Life , " which , you know , a small , independent movie that did very well , but a lot of people thought it was incredibly confusing , a little bizarre . Academy loved it , Terrence Malick , very reclusive director , did well . But the big winner here is Brad Pitt . He produced two of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Life . " That 's a real testament to his power , not just as an actor but as a producer . But I have to -- I think one of the biggest surprises in all of this is Melissa McCarthy in " Bridesmaids " and -- for Best Supporting Actress . I think we saw at the Golden Globes , Ricky Gervais on stage made the joke , this is a movie where her character has diarrhea in a sink and you know it 's amazing that the Academy rewarded this kind of movie . It 's great , its funny , but it 's not an Academy-style movie . @!CURRY: Another surprise might be Gary Oldman , not because he 's not terrific ... @!Ms-MIN: Yes . @!CURRY: ... but because he was n't considered predicted . @!Ms-MIN: OK , exactly . He was considered -- he was considered a dark horse , a long shot in this . He , Leonardo DiCaprio for " J. Edgar " did not get a nomination , neither did Michael Fassbender from " Shame . " So that -- that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we 've got a very good looking Best Actor category in here , between George Clooney , Jean Dujardin , Brad Pitt , Gary Oldman , Demian Bichir . I mean ... @!Ms-MIN: Yeah , it wo n't -- it wo n't be hard to watch this show , definitely . @!CURRY: In fact , it may be one of the best looking Best Actor categories ever . @!Ms-MIN: The best looking Best Actor category in history , yes . @!LAUER: We talked about " The Artist " beforehand , I mean , pretty big , pretty big nominations . @!Ms-MIN: I mean -- did they not get nominated for -- they got nominated for everything they were up for , I believe . I mean it was a pretty clean sweep , I believe . You know , this is an incredible accomplishment for a silent movie , one where there are no name stars , a no-name actor . It just really captured the imagination of the Academy in a big way . @!LAUER: All right . So I think you did very well with your cheat sheet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . @!LAUER: Nice job . And again , we are now going to be joined by the cast from " The Artist . " They just had a very big morning . With us now from Paris , the film 's Oscar nominated stars Jean Dujardin and Berenice Bejo and director , Michel -- go ahead ... @!CURRY: Michel Hazanavicius , I think . @!LAUER: ... and producer Thomas Langmann . Guys , I hope I did n't mess -- we did n't mess the name of your director up too much . @!CURRY: We tried . @!LAUER: But congratulations . What a day . @!Mr-JEAN-DUJARDIN: Yeah . You 're right . Thank you . @!Mr-MICHEL-HAZANAVI: Thank you . @!Ms-BERENICE-BEJO-@: Thank you . @!Mr-THOMAS-LANGMANN: Thank you . @!LAUER: What was the reaction in the room as you started to hear one nomination after another come through ? @!Mr-LANGMANN: We were happy , we were very happy . @!CURRY: Michel , especially since we did n't do such a great job with your name . When you took the risk of making a black and white silent film , did you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this morning and celebrating an Oscar nomination , not for one -- in one category , but for yourself in two ? @!Mr-HAZANAVICIUS: Yeah . No , I absolutely did not expect something like that . We made this film really by passion and with our hearts and we never thought it was possible to go so high with an Oscar nomination . And it 's unexpected . It really -- it was a small film . And we -- it 's unbelievable . We are very -- I think I 'm the happiest director in the world today so it 's a big surprise . @!LAUER: And Jean and Berenice , were there friends of yours who thought you were a little crazy for taking on this role ? @!Ms-BEJO: Crazy ? I do n't think so . But lucky . You know , most of the people said , ' Wow , that 's so unique , so special . You 're so lucky to be able to do something like that . Really . @!CURRY: Jean . @!Ms-BEJO: And that 's the way I feel now . Very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? @!Mr-DUJARDIN: Yeah . @!Ms-BEJO: ( Speaking French ) @!Mr-DUJARDIN: Oh , yes . Me , too . I 'm crazy , I think so . @!LAUER: Do you all think that based on the chances ... @!Mr-LANGMANN: We 're all very , very happy to be here . @!LAUER: I know . Do you think that based on the chances that were taken in the making of this movie that it will -- it will cause some other producers and directors down the road to be a little bit more creative and take more chances in the movies they choose to do ? @!Mr-HAZANAVICIUS: Well , I 'm not sure . It 's -- we do n't have to say what should do the other ones . I mean , we took our chance because we believed in that movie and that 's the movie we really want to make and to see . And if it can help other directors I would be very glad but it 's not my mission . I just want to make movies . And I do n't know . I 'm so happy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , congratulations once again to all of you . You 're all stars , but maybe one of the biggest stars of your movie is joining us this morning . We 've got Uggy the dog who 's also in the movie , " The Artist . " And Uggy , I want to know , you know , just basically how do you feel about all the attention ? @!Ms-BEJO: Oh ! Uggy ! @!LAUER: After all , it is a silent movie . OK ? @!CURRY: How do you feel about all the attention , Uggy ? What are your feelings about it ? @(Dog-barks) @!Ms-BEJO: Woof , woof , woof. @!LAUER: If I understand my dog he 's also congratulating all of you on your many nominations . So folks , the cast and producer and director of " The Artist . " @!Ms-BEJO: Thank you . @!Mr-DUJARDIN: Thank you . @!Mr-HAZANAVICIUS: Thank you . @!Mr-LANGMANN: Thank you . @!LAUER: Congratulations again . @!CURRY: Congratulations . @!LAUER: And up next , we 're going to talk to Oscar nominee Brad Pitt . What a day he is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . @!CURRY: Aw ! ' 
##4103537 @!LAUER , co-host : We 're back now at 8:09 with TODAY 'S PROFESSIONALS . Here to weigh in on the latest headlines and trends , Star Jones , Donny Deutsch and Dr. Nancy Snyderman . Morning all . @!Dr-NANCY-@: Hey . @!Mr-DONNY-DEUTSCH-@: Hey , Matt. @!Ms-STAR-JONES: Hey , thanks . @!LAUER: Good to see you . We 've got lots of topics for you let 's get right to it . After weeks of answering questions or facing questions about his tax returns , why he would n't release them and what was in them , Mitt Romney did that this morning . We 've now seen his 2010 tax return and an estimate from 2011 . Does this matter to you ? Does it matter what 's in a candidate 's tax return as long as it 's not something illegal ? @!Mr-DEUTSCH: Honestly , he 's a successful guy . Guess what ? And he plays within the rules . That 's the tax rate for a guy at that level . Now if you do n't like the law , that 's one thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to stop punishing this guy because he 's successful , politics aside . @!Ms-JONES: I do n't think that -- I do n't think that it should impact on whether or not you like him or not . I just think it 's a good way to highlight wealth , taxation and inequality in the United States . I think it 's going to impact more in the general election than a Republican primary . @!Mr-DEUTSCH: Star , no , it 's not about that . @!SNYDERMAN: I thought the -- I thought the big stumble was not owning it early on and really talking about this . This is a self-made man . Because I agree with you , neither he nor Newt Gingrich is poor , let 's be real . @!Ms-JONES: None of these people are poor . @!SNYDERMAN: These are wealthy men . So it give you a chance to see the legality of the tax structure . But he should have done it earlier . That 's what I think . @!LAUER: Well , and I also think we 've had wealthy presidents in the past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @!LAUER: And we 've had not so wealthy presidents in the past . Does it make any difference in terms of being able to solve problems for the average citizen ? @!Mr-DEUTSCH: JFK who was probably known as the most populist president of our time . His family was the fifth wealthiest family in the country when he got elected , so . @!SNYDERMAN: Right . @!Ms-JONES: It 's about empathy , though . There 's an opportunity for us to say I am a person of privilege . @!SNYDERMAN: Well , did you empathize with Jimmy Carter because he came in as , you know , the son of a peanut farmer ? @!Ms-JONES: It was n't about him being poor , it 's not even about Romney being wealthy . It 's just the ability to understand that other people suffer . You need to go into a grocery store every now and again . @!SNYDERMAN: No. @!Mr-DEUTSCH: But what does that -- so -- but , he 's been a very successful guy . @!SNYDERMAN: I 'm with Donny on this one . @!Mr-DEUTSCH: He 's a capitalist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ round of applause for that . @!LAUER: All right , OK. @!SNYDERMAN: I think the interesting thing is what 's in the Swiss bank account . That 's all I want to know . @!LAUER: To each his own . Let 's move on . All right . Remember this couple in the UK ? They had a baby and they refused to tell the baby 's gender for five years . This week they revealed that Sasha is in fact a little boy . They had been raising him gender neutral and they released a video of that little boy saying that 's it 's silly to differentiate between boys and girls . Is it silly ? @!SNYDERMAN: Well , when I first heard about this story I thought this was going to be a baby born with something we call ambiguous genitalia , where you really ca n't tell if you have a boy or girl . And doctors will say raise this child neutral and the child will determine his or her own sexuality . Do n't force it . Then I found that these kids -- these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . @!Ms-JONES: Right . @!SNYDERMAN: And tried to play it down the middle . You ca n't fiddle with nature vs. nurture that much . Children will determine themselves . I think it 's a silly little experiment . @!Mr-DEUTSCH: As my -- one of my daughters would go , ew. @!Ms-JONES: I like that . @!Mr-DEUTSCH: I mean , this is a little boy . By the way he talks about that he likes to wear tutus . God bless . Matt , I 've confided often to you my tutu years . @!Ms-JONES: Yeah , mm-hmm . @!Mr-DEUTSCH: But I mean to not say what this kid is to the rest of the world is almost deviant . @!Ms-JONES: This is all about the parents and their little angst project . @!SNYDERMAN: Yeah , yeah . @!Ms-JONES: This is not about the kid . And in the best interests of the child , let the child go out and be the little boy he is . Now if he wants to hang with the little girls that 's cool . @!Mr-DEUTSCH: Sure . @!Ms-JONES: But do n't try to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really ... @!Ms-JONES: They 're calling him the infant , not even the boy . @!Mr-DEUTSCH: Social services should really get involved . That 's just wrong . @!SNYDERMAN: And you know what , and you ca n't . Because kids play as we talked about before . @!Ms-JONES: Yes . @!SNYDERMAN: The boys are going to blow things up and shoot their guns . The girls are playing for ... @!Mr-DEUTSCH: But there 's a distinction . Once again , let the boy do whatever he wants . @!SNYDERMAN: That 's my point . @!Mr-DEUTSCH: Girl , whether it 's conventional girls stuff . But do n't not acknowledge that he 's a boy . @!LAUER: All right . Let 's move on . Joe Paterno died this week ... @!Ms-JONES: Mm. @!SNYDERMAN: Yes . @!LAUER: ... at the age of 85 . His son Jay was on the program this morning talking about his dad 's legacy . In light of what 's happened at Penn State over the last couple of months with the Jerry Sandusky scandal and criticisms of Joe Paterno for perhaps not doing enough to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , how do you think this will affect his legacy ? @!Ms-JONES: Matt , I actually believe Coach Paterno when he said it was almost an ew factor to him , that he could n't fathom a man having raped another man . So I actually believe that in his spirit and sort of his background that that may have occurred . I do n't think that a person 's legacy is decided by one action or inaction . I think you look at a man 's total life , that 's all . @!LAUER: Yeah , but people are harsh when they judge . @!SNYDERMAN: Yep . @!LAUER: Donny , what do you think 's going happen ? @!Mr-DEUTSCH: Yeah , look . This is a man who was a great man by many standards . You talk to the people that came through and he affected them , who obviously made a bad judgment call . @!Ms-JONES: That 's right . Yes . @!Mr-DEUTSCH: Very bad judgement call . It does not define his life , though . And , you know , we 've to be careful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any standard . @!Ms-JONES: Mm-hmm . @!Mr-DEUTSCH: You know , I do n't care what age he is , vs. you can talk to thousands of people that played for him and said he molded me as a human being . So we can separate , I think we 're ... @!Ms-JONES: Yes . @!Mr-DEUTSCH: ... intelligent and broad enough to separate the two . @!SNYDERMAN: One of the things that really hit me was when he -- how quickly he became ill and then died . When he first -- when they first said he had lung cancer I thought , eh , you know , is everyone buying -- playing for time ? And then he really went downhill fast . The idea that he lost the job he loved , the fact that he had cancer , the phenomenal stress . @!LAUER: Mind-body connection . @!SNYDERMAN: Listen , I have no doubt that the stress of this may have pushed everything faster . @!LAUER: By the way , Bear Bryant , a legendary coach for Alabama football , died four weeks after he gave up the job that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broken heart syndrome and turning on a cancer faster . @!LAUER: All right . @!Mr-DEUTSCH: I think there 's a lesson for -- very extreme case . But so many people when they stop working ... @!Ms-JONES: Mm-hmm . @!Mr-DEUTSCH: ... it just -- everything else falls apart . @!SNYDERMAN: And especially if it 's taken away from you . @!Mr-DEUTSCH: Yeah , it 's sad . @!LAUER: I 'm curious to see what you guys think about this one . The Stanley Cup champion Boston Bruins were at the White House yesterday for that photo op with the president that so many championship teams get . @!SNYDERMAN: Right , right . @!LAUER: Their goalie , Tim Thomas , decided not to attend . He released on Facebook why . He said , " Today I exercised my right as a free citizen , did not visit the White House . This was not about politics or party as in my opinion both parties are responsible for the situation we 're in as a country . This was about a choice I had to make as an individual . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fair choice ? @!Mr-DEUTSCH: Well , first of all it 's a free country . Having said that though , it 's the White House , the office of the president . And I think what 's so silly about what he did , regardless of where you stand on politics , regardless where you stand on the current state , this is the greatest country in the world and I think you 're going like this at this amazing institution and ... @!SNYDERMAN: Well , remember when John Boehner did n't go to one of the official dinners and I had the same reaction . This is not about the person who 's there for four or eight years , this is the office of the presidency . @!LAUER: Yeah . @!Ms-JONES: And you ... @!SNYDERMAN: And it 's just rude not to go . @!Ms-JONES: You know what ? Let 's take it off just good common sense . How about if you really feel that there 's some situations going on in this country you want to talk about , you have the ear of the president @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's kind of ... @!Mr-DEUTSCH: Well , that 's not , he 's not doing one on one . @!LAUER: It 's not very long , it 's a pretty quick photo opt here . @!SNYDERMAN: Ah . @!Ms-JONES: You know what ? I got ta tell you , you get a minute , I get a chance to chat with you for thirty seconds , I 'm going to do what I can . I 'm going to do it . @!Mr-DEUTSCH: Well , that 's you . I mean ... @!LAUER: Did he -- did he do his teammates a disservice ? This is a team sport , not an individual sport . @!SNYDERMAN: Yeah , everyone in sports . @!Mr-DEUTSCH: I think he did , and the city of Boston , and the city of Boston . Boy , what an honor to be able to go to the White House in this country . @!SNYDERMAN: He cheapened it , he cheapened it . @!Ms-JONES: Well , he wo n't get that opportunity again . I would n't give him another invitation . @!SNYDERMAN: No , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end on this one . I love Steven Tyler , OK . So I 'm going to -- there 's a disclaimer right off the bat , all right . I like him , he 's a good guy , I 've had a lot of fun with him over the years . He was invited to sing the national anthem before the Ravens-Patriots game over the weekend . Here 's a clip . @(Clip-of-Steve-Tyle @!SNYDERMAN: I loved it . I loved it . @!LAUER: I did n't ask the question yet . @!Mr-DEUTSCH: Yeah . @!LAUER: But that 's OK , go ahead . @!Mr-DEUTSCH: You 're also still wearing your cocktail dress from last night , so . @!Ms-JONES: I mean , exactly . @!LAUER: All right . You loved it ? @!SNYDERMAN: I did . I think it was exuberant , it was Tyler . @!LAUER: Because the reaction was mixed . @!SNYDERMAN: Well , guess what , he 's -- I mean , well , he 's not Pavarotti . @!Ms-JONES: No. @!SNYDERMAN: But I loved it . @!Ms-JONES: Nancy , only Eric Clapton is an old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @!SNYDERMAN: Then do n't invite him . @!Ms-JONES: Give me a break . @!Mr-DEUTSCH: While we 're on it , can I ? And this is not going to be popular at NBC , why is Madonna playing the Super Bowl ? @!LAUER: Oh , wait a second , do n't go there . Will you stick to the subject , please ? @!Mr-DEUTSCH: No , but I 'm serious . @!LAUER: No , no , stick to the subject . @!Mr-DEUTSCH: It 's like , that 's not -- why -- that is the subject . @!LAUER: Stick to the subject . @!Mr-DEUTSCH: No , this is the subject . @!SNYDERMAN: Do we get Steve Tyler back ? @!Mr-DEUTSCH: No , this is the subject . Because we choose these people . By the way , it was entertaining . @!Ms-JONES: You know what , Kristin Chenoweth did a good job . @!Mr-DEUTSCH: It was funny , who cares . @!Ms-JONES: No , Steven Tyler does not need to be screaming the national anthem . @!Mr-DEUTSCH: Oh , what 's the difference , it 's in -- it 's still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And it 's his artistic interpretation . And Nancy liked it , so I like it . @!SNYDERMAN: You know what ... @!Mr-DEUTSCH: Why ca n't we talk about why I do n't think Madonna is right on the Super Bowl ? @!LAUER: Because we 're out of time . @!SNYDERMAN: Ah . @!LAUER: Star Jones , Donny Deutsch , Dr. Nancy Snyderman , good to see you all . Still ahead , this morning 's Oscar nominations . And up next , a delicious and affordable winter meal your family is going to love right after this . ' 
##4103538 @!GIFFORD , co-host : So listen , for everybody that had to win , somebody had to lose , so we send our love to all the people in Baltimore and ... @!HODA-KOTB-co-host: @!Right-Well-even-i# @!GIFFORD: ... elsewhere . @!KOTB: OK , let 's start with this . If you 're not a football fan at all , let 's pretend , but you do like to watch because it 's the big hoopla , there are two things I know everyone watched and it was the National Anthems that were ... @!GIFFORD: Oh , yes . Oh , yes . @!KOTB: ... sung before each game . Now one person -- it was Steven Tyler and Kristin Chenoweth . Steven Tyler sparked a lot of controversy . @!GIFFORD: Are there two people more different ? More disalike than -- is that a -- is that a word ? @!KOTB: That , too . @!GIFFORD: Yeah . Yeah . @!KOTB: All right . So let 's watch Steven Tyler as he sang the National Anthem , please . @!GIFFORD: Study in contrasts . @(Clip-of-Steven-Tyl @!KOTB: Now he got knocked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He -- that 's how he sings . @!KOTB: But -- that 's -- yes , that 's -- if you hire Steven Tyler , that 's who you get . @!GIFFORD: You ai n't going to get Michael Buble. @!KOTB: Yeah . @!GIFFORD: You know ? @!KOTB: Right . @!GIFFORD: Plus , he 's Canadian so he probably would n't sing it anyway . But you know , that 's what you 're going to get . @!KOTB: Yes , I agree . @!GIFFORD: He 's known for ... @(screams) . @!KOTB: And Kristin Chenoweth was the complete opposite . @!GIFFORD: How adorable is she ? @!KOTB: Beautiful . In this pouring rain she sung beautifully . She was before the 49ers-Giants game . @!GIFFORD: Yeah . She 's an old Broadway trouper , the show must go on eight shows a week , and she was awesome . @!KOTB: She nailed it . She nailed it . @!GIFFORD: She nailed it , yeah . @!KOTB: Did n't you -- would n't you have died , though , if you were the kicker ... @!GIFFORD: The kicker. @!KOTB: ... for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kid . And he had -- he was 16 for 16 up till that point . @!KOTB: So if you watched the game ... @!GIFFORD: Oh , it just -- nobody could believe it . @!KOTB: ... there was 10 -- 15 seconds left and all they had to do was hit that so that they could go into overtime and ... @!GIFFORD: And he was n't very far ... @!KOTB: ... and it did n't happen . @!GIFFORD: I know . I ... @!KOTB: You know what ... @!GIFFORD: And it was n't a bad snap , it was n't ... @!KOTB: Oh , oh , oh . @!GIFFORD: ... it was -- it was just ... @!KOTB: Oh . @!GIFFORD: You know , I -- and they had to , of course , fly back to Baltimore . @!KOTB: Yeah . @!GIFFORD: And it 's a long way from San Francisco to Baltimore , you know ? @!KOTB: Yeah . @!GIFFORD: And they get -- usually get on a plane right after the game , and I said to Frank , I said , ' What 's it like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when you get on the plane and you go back and you -- you 're the one that basically cost the game ? ' @!KOTB: Yeah . What 'd he say ? @!GIFFORD: And I said , ' Are the guys great , honey ? Do they just come up to you and go , " You know what " ' ... @!KOTB: Yeah . @!GIFFORD: ...

So -- pretty darn lonely the whole way . @!KOTB: It was ... @!GIFFORD: By the way ... @!KOTB: What ? @!GIFFORD: ... you were n't here last Thursday when ... @!KOTB: I ... @!GIFFORD: ... when my mother and Regis -- when all pandemonium -- I want to thank Trudie Styler for being so sweet when we -- when my mother pressed the wrong button and we went someplace in this building I 've never been to in my life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she looking ? @!KOTB: OK . First of all , there 's been such feedback about this show , and this is an understatement , but the part that got the most feedback of all was a game show that took place . @!GIFFORD: Yes . @!KOTB: And we 're trying to figure out who knew more about you , whether it was your mother or Regis. @!GIFFORD: Who knew me better , right . @!KOTB: We have to see this clip because I have to see it . @!GIFFORD: Yeah , Hoda has n't seen it yet . @(Clip-from-previous @!GIFFORD: Finish this lyric to my song .

I heard . @!GIFFORD: He knows your name is -- you know the only answer he got right in that thing ? @!KOTB: What ? @!GIFFORD: He knew exactly how long you and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't think he didn't. @!KOTB: Uh-huh . @!GIFFORD: Yeah , he called on Saturday to say that he had had a really , really great time . @!KOTB: And ... @!GIFFORD: And you know what , I think he did n't want to hurt anybody over at ABC by being on -- by co-hosting with me ... @!KOTB: Yeah . @!GIFFORD: ... is what I finally gathered from him . I said , ' Nobody 's ' ... @!KOTB: Yeah . @!GIFFORD: ... ' everybody would understand that , Reeg. ' @!KOTB: Right . @!GIFFORD: So I think I talked him into hosting with us ... @!KOTB: To come back again ? @!GIFFORD: ... yeah -- one of these times , so . @!KOTB: He 's got to come back . What did Frank think about the game , by the way ? @!GIFFORD: Well , he 's still talking about how much Trudie Styler wants him . Let me get back to Trudie Styler , OK ? @!KOTB: She was hitting on him ? @!GIFFORD: She -- here 's the thing , I love Trudie Styler , so do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doll . @!KOTB: Sweet . @!GIFFORD: Sweetheart . @!KOTB: Yeah . @!GIFFORD: Sweetheart . She was in her adorable little yoga clothes and she did get a short shrift because we got lost in the building , and so last my husband was seen was right over by the kitchen talking to Trudie Styler . And ... @!KOTB: That 's Sting 's wife , by the way . @!GIFFORD: Sting 's wife ... @!KOTB: Mm-hmm . @!GIFFORD: ... by the way , OK ? Sting . And so I took my mom downstairs to go have a little piece of her birthday cake . @!KOTB: Yeah . And ? @!GIFFORD: Ticktock , where 's Frank ? Not for 15 more minutes . @!KOTB: Where was he ? @!GIFFORD: Finally , I was walking down the steps to go -- to go home and there 's Trudie with all her girlfriends and I go -- and she goes , ' Oh , my God , your husband is so gorgeous ! I ca n't believe -- he told me how old he is . My God , he 's gorgeous ! I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sting ? ' @!KOTB: Yeah . Back off . @!GIFFORD: ' You need my husband , too ? So anyway , Frank was a little enamored with Miss Styler , who 's also Mrs. Sumner , all right ? Back off , Barbie . I 'm telling you . But you know what ? @!KOTB: What ? @!GIFFORD: When somebody else finds your guy attractive , it 's a bit of a turn-on , I got to tell you . The fact that Sting 's wife -- huh -- thinks my husband ... @!KOTB: There is ... @!GIFFORD: Yes . @!KOTB: There 's something about that . Someone ... @!GIFFORD: I was looking at Frank all weekend like , gosh , you are a great-looking guy . @!KOTB: It took -- it took Trudie. @!GIFFORD: It took Trudie. @!KOTB: All right .

My favorite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other day , I went to go visit a friend who lost a member of her family , and I was -- as I was flying through I picked up this book and it 's called " A Simple Act of Gratitude . " And it 's about a guy whose life is caving in , his job is terrible , he 's losing -- he does n't have any money , his kids -- everything 's wrong . @!GIFFORD: Right . @!KOTB: And he has never written a thank you note to anybody in his life , and he gets a thank you note from someone and it touches him . So he decides over the course of a year for 365 days he 's going to write a thank you note every single day to somebody . And it changes his life . @!GIFFORD: Gratitude always does . @!KOTB: He gives a thank you note to the barista at Starbucks who remembers his name , and he says , ' Look , I just want to tell you it meant a lot that every day I walk in you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know -- is it going to be a venti ? " And it touched that guy . And he found out that he got money , he got his health back , he got everything back slowly ... @!GIFFORD: Everything . @!KOTB: ... over -- just over the course of a year . And it seemed like an easy exercise . @!GIFFORD: It 's just -- it 's so simple and we stumble over it . @!KOTB: Yeah . @!GIFFORD: That 's why I love Ann 's book ... @!KOTB: You do . Yeah . @!GIFFORD: ... you know , " A Thousand -- A Thousand Gifts . " @!KOTB: That 's a great book . @!GIFFORD: Just fantastic . I got the sweetest note from her . @!KOTB: You did ? @!GIFFORD: Yeah . You know , that 's how those things go . @!KOTB: What you got ? Go . @!GIFFORD: My favorite thing is this . @!KOTB: What ? @!GIFFORD: Now this might look like a little thing , and it is a little thing , it 's called Doctor 's Brush Picks . @!KOTB: Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your local drugstore. @!KOTB: Oh , no. @!GIFFORD: But look at this . This is not a toothpick . I mean , it 's a toothpick on one end , but on this end it 's a little teeny brush . Can you see that ? @!KOTB: Yeah . @!GIFFORD: Now watch , I 'm going to -- I 'm going go show you how it works . @!KOTB: Do n't do it . @!GIFFORD: Yes . @!KOTB: Do n't do it . @!GIFFORD: And I 'm going to -- and I 'm going to show my other talent at the same time .

Can I finish my thing ? @!KOTB: No , a woman -- a woman was flossing her teeth like this next to me in jury duty the whole time . I kept staring at her , I could n't take it . It reminded me of that . @!GIFFORD: But this is like this little teeny brush , it 's so -- it 's so -- because , you know , I do n't know why but my teeth are the most expensive part of my body if you know what I mean , but when I eat anything ... @!KOTB: Things get stuck . @!GIFFORD: ... it shows up in my teeth . Other people -- my daughter has huge , beautiful , natural teeth ... @!KOTB: Wait , when ... @!GIFFORD: ... nothing sticks to them . @!KOTB: Where and when do you use these ?

What you got ? @!HAINES: OK . This is my Reebok shapewear double-layer tank and I 'm obsessed with it because underneath here , which I was just showing Hoda , is another layer that does shapewear , so you know when you have that excuse like , ' I feel fat , I 'm not going to the gym , well , now you have no excuse . @!KOTB: Yeah . It 's like Spanx in your -- get that -- ew. @!HAINES: Because this whole thing tucks you in so you already look like you worked out before you even start .

##4103539 @!LESTER-HOLT: Welcome to DATELINE , everyone . I 'm Lester Holt . It 's a case so controversial people came out in the streets to protests . It 's about a pair of newlyweds who had just settled into a new life together . But what began as a typical night at home ended in a heartbreaking mystery . Tonight you 'll hear from the husband at the center of it all in his only television interview . Here 's Dennis Murphy . @!DENNIS-MURPHY-repo: @(Voiceover) Sometimes the shades are drawn early in a marriage , even for young couples so in love , like newlyweds Sarah and Ryan . Everything in life was still fresh , even at home on your average Monday night . After his workday as a sports planner , Ryan said he plopped down on the sofa on an August night to chill with the Bengals preseason opener against Green Bay . Sarah , he says , went upstairs to draw a bath in the master . She liked her calming baths . The young dental hygienist had been tormented with more of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cincinnati home that evening had been married for just under four months , 114 days , to be exact . They 'd vowed " till death do us part , " and that moment was only minutes away from arriving . @(House-exterior-at- @!MURPHY: @(Voiceover) They 'd begun -- the two of them -- with a blind date at a pub that worked out . Sarah , Sarah Steward , had been fixed up by her friend Dana Kist . Dana had an inkling that Sarah would really hit it off with her husband Chris former college roommate , Ryan Widmer. @(Bar-interior; @!Ms-DANA-KIST: @(Voiceover) I came home and I said , ' Sarah is amazing . ' @(Photo-of-Ryan-and- @!Ms-KIST: I said , ' I think this -- their personalities would really get along . He said , ' Well , let 's let them go to dinner and see what happens . ' @!MURPHY: What happened over drinks and nibbles was chemistry . Laid-back Ryan , the college jock and baseball player , super organized Sarah , who needed everything just so , talked about getting together again . @!Ms-KIST: She said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So she gets out her little black book . And , you know , she 's looking through , and he 's peeking over looking , you know , and he said -- later he calls us and tells us , ' You know , there was nothing written in her black book . ' @!MURPHY: @(Voiceover) It was a fast-track courtship , and before very long Ryan was bringing his new girlfriend home to meet his mom , Jill . @(Photo-of-Ryan-and- @!Ms-JILL-WIDMER: I liked her a lot . Probably number one thing that struck me the most was how beyond her years in maturity she was , you know . @!MURPHY: Poised , huh ? @!Ms-WIDMER: Yeah , and Sarah did n't have a problem telling anyone anything . So if you made Sarah mad , you knew you made Sarah mad . @!MURPHY: @(Voiceover) As for Ryan , he never seemed to lose it . @(Photo-of-Ryan) @!Mr-CHRIS-KIST: I do n't think I 've ever seen him upset . He does n't get mad , you know . @!Ms-KIST: @(Voiceover) He 's so laid-back and kind of easygoing , go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so on it , organized , ' This is where we have to be , and he just says OK. @!MURPHY: @(Voiceover) Jill Widmer enjoyed her days with Ryan and his new girlfriend , Sarah . @(Jill-Widmer-and-do @!Ms-WIDMER: Our family tends to do a lot of barbecues and picnics and things like that . We would spend some time down on a lake in Kentucky . They would come down there . @!MURPHY: @(Voiceover) Were you pleased she was becoming a serious part of the family ? @(Home-video-of-Ryan @!Ms-WIDMER: @(Voiceover) I was very pleased , yes . @(Home-video-of-Ryan @!MURPHY: @(Voiceover) The inseparable couple bought a nice four-bedroom house together in a good neighborhood , and Ryan surprised Sarah with an engagement ring . @(Photo-of-Ryan-and- @!Ms-KIST: @(Voiceover) He put the ring ... @(Photo-of-Ryan-and- @!Mr-KIST: There was a ring in a dog collar . @(Photo-of-Ryan-and- @!Ms-KIST: @(Voiceover) ... around the dog 's collar . @(Photo-of-Ryan-and- @!Mr-KIST: @(Voiceover) She was very excited . @(Photo-of-Ryan-and- @!Mr-KIST: He was very excited . Sarah made him happy . @!MURPHY: @(Voiceover) And soon the wedding invitations were in the mail . The bridesmaids knew they 'd better snap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had everything ready to go . She wanted to make sure all the girls wore the same makeup , same eyeshadow , same -- bought us our little makeup kits for the wedding so we all looked the same . @!MURPHY: How 's Ryan doing ? @!Ms-KIST: He was just as happy as I -- I mean , happier than I 've ever seen him , with her . @!MURPHY: @(Voiceover) It cost Sarah a big screen TV to seal the deal , but she got Ryan to take ballroom dance lessons for the wedding . @(Photo-of-Ryan-and- @!Ms-WIDMER: And I was amazed . I mean , never in a million years would I think . .. @!MURPHY: Your son at dance lessons ? @!Ms-WIDMER: Yeah . She could get him to do more things than any woman he had ever dated . @!MURPHY: @(Voiceover) The wedding in April 2008 was a formal affair . The bride was beautiful , Ryan 's dance came off without a hitch , and the happy bridesmaids all matched , just as Sarah wanted . @(Wedding-photos-of- @!Ms-KIST: Very beautiful . I mean , every detail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... because it was Sarah , but -- and she was gorgeous . @(Wedding-photo-of-S @!Mr-KIST: It was awesome . @!Ms-KIST: Oh , it was probably the most fun wedding we 've ever been to . @!Mr-KIST: It was fun . @!Ms-KIST: Ever . @!MURPHY: @(Voiceover) The newlyweds went to Costa Rica for their honeymoon and had a great time . Then it was back to Cincinnati to begin their journey together as Mr. and Mrs. Ryan Widmer. @(Photo-of-Ryan-and- @!Ms-WIDMER: @(Voiceover) They worked really hard . They built a beautiful deck on the back of their house . They had a trip planned to Cancun . @(House-exterior; @!Ms-WIDMER: They had everything to live for . @!MURPHY: So August 11th should have been just another day on the calendar in the young marriage , huh ? @!Ms-WIDMER: It should have been , yes . @!MURPHY: @(Voiceover) August 11th , Monday night , Ryan remembers being downstairs watching " Monday Night Football " ; Sarah had gone upstairs to her bath . She was in trouble . @(House-exterior; -fo Unidentified 911 Operator : @(911-audiotape) 911 , what 's your emergency ? @!Mr-RYAN-WIDMER: @(911-audiotape) I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bathtub , I think . I was downstairs . I just came up here , and she was laying facedown in the bathtub. @!Ms-WIDMER: I got a call . It was Ryan . ' Something 's happened to Sarah . ' @!MURPHY: @(Voiceover) The EMTs were rushing Sarah to the hospital . By then they 'd worked on her for 45 minutes but had n't gotten a response . Minutes later , Jill Widmer was with her son waiting anxiously together in a room off emergency . @(Flashing-colored-l @!Ms-WIDMER: Finally , a woman came in , and then we said , ' Is she gone ? And she said yes . He just dropped down to his knees and was just bawling and sobbing , you know , into the chair . @!MURPHY: @(Voiceover) Sarah Widmer , 24 years old , the bride of less than four months , was dead . Her husband , Ryan , told the emergency services people he thought she 'd fallen asleep in the bathtub and drowned , but those EMTs doing CPR , trying everything they could to save her , did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night , there 's something here that does n't look right . @(Photo-of-Ryan-and- @!HOLT: Coming up , a drowning in a dry bathroom ? Detective JEFF BRALEY : I expected something to be wet . @(Voiceover) There 's a towel on the floor . There was a mat on the floor , but everything is perfectly dry . @(Photos-of-bathroom @!HOLT: @(Voiceover) The questions deepen , when The Bathtub Mystery continues . @(Crime-scene-photos @(Announcements) @!MURPHY: @(Voiceover) That Monday night the Cincinnati Bengals were looking more than decent against Green Bay . Fans across town , like Jeff Braley , wondered if this could finally be a miracle season for the back then hapless local franchise of the NFL . But Braley did n't get to see all of the game . He 's a cop , a detective , and you do n't get to pick your down time . @(Football-game-on-t @!Det-BRALEY: @(Voiceover) I 'm at home watching the Bengals game , and I get a call from my sergeant . @(Car) @!Det-BRALEY: ' Lieutenant , we 're out on a drowning . The paramedics are still working on her , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he rolled to the house that night , he knew some of what to expect . When you 're a cop for more than a decade , you become familiar with the signs of a drowning , like the froth about the victim 's nose and mouth . @(Flashing-lights; @!Det-BRALEY: @(Voiceover) Your mind starts running immediately about possibilities . @(Flashing-lights) @!Det-BRALEY: They initially tell me I 've got a 24-year-old drowning victim that died in the tub . I 'm thinking that we 're going to find evidence of something . You know , we 're going to find some drugs or evidence of an overdose or something . @!MURPHY: @(Voiceover) As he pulled up , the victim was already loaded in the back of the ambulance . The arriving police officer was still inside the house , and he gave the detective a fill on what he 'd found when he was led to the master bedroom where the 24-year-old woman lay on the carpet off the bath . @(Braley-exiting-veh @!Det-BRALEY: He felt for a pulse . He assisted with CPR on what he described as a completely dry body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head , dry body ? @!Det-BRALEY: That 's correct . @!MURPHY: For someone who drowned in a bathtub full of water ? @!Det-BRALEY: Yes . 911 Operator : @(911-audiotape) Go ahead and get her out of the bathtub and get her on a flat surface . @!Mr-WIDMER: @(911-audiotape) OK , OK. @!MURPHY: @(Voiceover) The 911 dispatcher had been quite clear about it . He had instructed the husband to get his wife out of the bathtub and put her on the floor . @(Photo-of-bathtub) @!Mr-WIDMER: @(911-audiotape) I 'm dropping the phone . @!MURPHY: @(Voiceover) The husband went away and came back on the line to say that he 'd just moved his wife from the tub to the bedroom . @(Bathroom) 911 Operator : @(911-audiotape) OK , go ahead and get back to CPR , go and try CPR . They 'll be there in a little bit , OK ? @!Mr-WIDMER: @(911-audiotape) OK. @!MURPHY: @(Voiceover) Detective Braley wondered , along with the EMTs and the arriving officers , why a woman who drowned in a bathtub would be mostly dry . He needed to see the scene . What story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mentally preparing myself based on what they 've told me , you know , what do I want to see vs. what do I see . @!MURPHY: @(Voiceover) He headed for the master bathroom . @(Photo-of-bedroom) @!Det-BRALEY: I expected something to be wet . I expected there to be water on the floors or towels or whatever it might be , and it 's simply not there . @!MURPHY: Dry , dry ? @!Det-BRALEY: There 's a very small remnant of water ... @(Voiceover) ... what you might call some droplets on the bottom of the tub right around the drain . @(Bathtub-drain) @!Det-BRALEY: Other than that there 's nothing . @!MURPHY: You got any bath mats , wet towels on the floor , that kind of thing ? @!Det-BRALEY: @(Voiceover) There 's a towel on the floor . There 's a mat on the floor , but everything 's perfectly dry . @(Crime-scene-photos @!MURPHY: @(Voiceover) Now he had not only a drowning victim who did n't appear to be wet , someone who supposedly fell asleep in the tub and pitched facedown in the water , but a bathroom itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the husband had to wrangle her limp body out of the tub as he moved her to the bedroom . @(Flashing-lights; @!Det-BRALEY: @(Voiceover) You know , whether it 's lotions or soaps , whatever 's sitting on the side , they were n't knocked off . @(Lysol-by-bathtub) @!Det-BRALEY: That bothered me , if you 're pulling somebody very quickly out of a tub , that that 's still together . @!MURPHY: @(Voiceover) The detective making mental notes . @(Bathtub) @!Det-BRALEY: Something was screaming to me , something 's bad wrong . Something bad , really , really bad has happened here , and more so than just a tragic accident where she drowned . @!MURPHY: @(Voiceover) The forensic techs arrived and were taking photos , cutting out sections of the bedroom carpet where the mixture of blood and fluid , common in drownings , had stained it . What they wondered is , was there another explanation for the stains ? @(Crime-scene-photos @!Det-BRALEY: We wanted to get those things to our lab right away to start -- just start checking out some things . @!MURPHY: @(Voiceover) Even though it was early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the findings of an autopsy , the detective knew that this was not a case that was going to be closed out that night . @(Braley-driving) @!Det-BRALEY: When I left the house at 2 AM , I knew I had a suspicious death . @!MURPHY: @(Voiceover) Still , there were questions . How long had Sarah been out of the tub ? And had she been out of the tub long enough for her body to air dry ? @(Bathtub) @!Det-BRALEY: @(Voiceover) It was n't possible . @(Crime-scene-photos @!Det-BRALEY: You know , if you 're pulling somebody directly out of a tub of water , the body has to be wet . There 's no other way around it , unless a substantial amount of time is passed or we 're not being told an accurate story of what actually transpired . @!MURPHY: @(Voiceover) Question : Was it possible for Ryan to lift Sarah out of the tub without knocking over those bottles that the detective noted were undisturbed ? Was it possible for water not to be splashed around as she was moved to the bedroom . And that overriding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her master bedroom ? @(Photo-of-bathtub; @!Det-BRALEY: @(Voiceover) And we knew that she had drowned ... @(Wedding-photo-of-R @!Det-BRALEY: ... just from the scene itself . It was the manner in which she drowned that was -- that had raised all the questions . @!MURPHY: @(Voiceover) But Detective Braley would have the most questions for the seemingly happily married husband . Was it possible their was stress in the marriage that no one knew about ? @(Braley; @!Det-BRALEY: @(Voiceover) I had to rely on the fact in the back of my mind that nobody knows what goes on behind closed doors . @(Photo-of-Ryan-and- @!HOLT: Coming up ... @!Ms-WIDMER: @(Voiceover) Did she have an aneurysm ? @(Photo-of-Sarah; @!Ms-WIDMER: Did she have a seizure ? @!HOLT: @(Voiceover) Was there something medical behind the mystery ? @(Braley-looking-at- @!Ms-KIST: @(Voiceover) She was complaining of headaches . I was telling her ... @(Photos-of-Sarah) @!Ms-KIST: ... ' How long has it been since you 've been to the doctor ? ' @!HOLT: @(Voiceover) When The Bathtub Mystery continues . @(Title-graphic) @(Announcements) @!MURPHY: @(Voiceover) Sarah Widmer had died of drowning in her home , and her body would be examined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , her husband of four months , to do but leave the hospital and head home . His mother , Jill Widmer , took him back to the house in the wee hours . @(Title-graphic; @!Ms-WIDMER: Ryan asked me , you know , he said , ' Mom , I ca n't go back in there . Can you go in and grab some clothes for me ? And so I went upstairs , and when I got upstairs to their bedroom , there were a couple pieces of carpet cut out of their carpeting , which I thought was odd . @!MURPHY: @(Voiceover) It had n't occurred to mother or son that the authorities were already looking at Sarah 's death as anything but a tragic , explainable incident of some sort . @(Braley-at-desk) @!Ms-WIDMER: There were a million questions in our mind . Did she have an aneurysm ? Did , you know , did something medically happen to her ? Did she have a seizure ? @!MURPHY: @(Voiceover) Daylight , and word was spreading that Sarah was gone . Dana and Chris , the couple who 'd fixed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hearing . @(Houses-exterior; @!Ms-KIST: We had just gotten back from a trip , and I told her that I 'd call her as soon as I got back so we could get together for dinner , and I did n't even get a chance to do that . @!Mr-KIST: Shocking news , to say the least . Shocking news . @!MURPHY: @(Voiceover) Dana , a nurse , tried to make some sense out of what had happened to her dear friend . She thought back to her last conversations with Sarah . @(Dana-walking; @!Ms-KIST: @(Voiceover) She was complaining of headaches . She would call and say , you know , ' What do you think from a medical backgrounds ? And I said , ' Well , maybe you should get your blood pressure checked . ' @(Photo-of-Dana-and- @!Ms-KIST: You know , and I was telling her , I said , ' You just basically need a checkup , you know ? How long has it been since you 've been to the doctor ? ' @!MURPHY: And then there was that funny trait Sarah had that people used to kid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the drop of a hat . Well , maybe that was n't so funny . Maybe that was part of an underlying condition that helped explain her sudden death . Her mother-in-law noticed it when she first got to know Sarah . @!Mr-WIDMER: @(Home-video) Where 's yours at ? @!MURPHY: @(Voiceover) It was Christmas 2007 , and Jill was taking home videos . @(Home-video) @!Ms-WIDMER: All of a sudden , I panned over ... @(Home-video) ... there 's Sarah , having a good time at the family Christmas . @(Voiceover) And Sarah was sound asleep in a chair in my family room . We were 15 or 20 people in the room , we 're all laughing , talking , kids running around , and she could just go to sleep . @(Home-video-of-Sara @!MURPHY: @(Voiceover) Sarah , asleep at the dinner table , snoozing in the car . Friends kidded her about it . @(Photo-of-Sarah) @!Ms-KIST: She would always fall asleep in the beginning of movies . So he would always -- he 'd be nudging her the whole time . ' Sarah , Sarah , wake up and watch this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you guys joked about it ? @!Mr-KIST: Every time we went somewhere , even at the dinner table , we 'd be laughing , like , ' Sarah , do n't fall asleep . ' @!Ms-KIST: I would always say , ' Sarah , you have narcolepsy . And she 'd say , ' Dana , I do not . I 'm just tired all the time . ' @!MURPHY: @(Voiceover) Had Sarah fallen asleep and drowned in the tub ? Was that even possible to do ? Ryan seemed to think so . He said as much to the 911 dispatcher. @(Photo-of-Sarah-and @!Mr-WIDMER: @(911-audiotape) My wife fell asleep in the bathtub , and I think she 's dead . @!MURPHY: @(Voiceover) But all the observations about sleepy Sarah , Sarah with her headaches , was just anecdotal information , not the stuff of real medical investigation . The medical examiner would have the first real results about Sarah 's death . @(Photos-of-Sarah; @!MURPHY: What was he finding ? @!Det-BRALEY: No evidence of a stroke , no evidence of a heart attack . @!MURPHY: @(Voiceover) But the medical examiner had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neck . What had caused those injuries ? The investigators checked off what they had so far : a young woman supposedly drowned in a bathtub with a damp head of hair and a dry body . It did n't figure . @(Autopsy-report; @!Det-BRALEY: If you 're pulling somebody directly out of a tub of water , the body has to be wet . There 's no other way around it . @!MURPHY: @(Voiceover) A victim with unexplained bruises , and a husband whose story they did n't believe about a ho-hum Monday night watching football , then finding his wife dead in the bath . @(Photo-of-Sarah-and @!Det-BRALEY: But Ryan 's story , it does n't fit . It does n't fit at all . We determined at that point we had a homicide . @!MURPHY: @(Voiceover) Sarah Widmer murdered , and the authorities believed her husband , Ryan , did it . @(Photo-of-Ryan-and- @!MURPHY: How shocking is that to you ? @!Ms-WIDMER: Oh , I ca n't even tell you . @!MURPHY: They 're going to charge Ryan with murder . @!Ms-WIDMER: I mean , you 've got to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ca n't even tell you what that was like . So , on top of losing this beautiful member of our family , he did n't even get a chance to grieve because now we 're scared to death and he 's scared to death that he 's going to be charged with murder . @!MURPHY: @(Voiceover) And that is exactly what would happen . Just two days after his new bride 's death , a warrant was issued for Ryan Widmer 's arrest . @(Photo-of-Ryan-and- @!Det-BRALEY: By Ryan 's own admission , he was the only one in the house . So Ryan murdered Sarah or he 's covering for somebody that did . @!MURPHY: @(Voiceover) It did n't seem possible at first glance , a clean-cut young couple , him without a criminal record of any kind , them with no clear-cut history of arguments , no problems in their marriage . Where was the motive for murder on a Monday night ? @(Photo-of-Ryan-and- @!MURPHY: @(Voiceover) Any boyfriend/girlfriend issues here ? @(Bathtub) @!Det-BRALEY: There was no evidence whatsoever to point that there was a girlfriend , boyfriend . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . @!MURPHY: Did you find any anger issues in the guy , in the ... @!Det-BRALEY: No . No. @!MURPHY: You 're really not getting a negative picture of this couple . @!Det-BRALEY: No , we 're not . @!MURPHY: @(Voiceover) As unlikely as it may have seemed , police said there was no other explanation for Sarah 's death . Ryan Widmer was charged with his wife 's murder . @(Bathtub-faucet; -sp Unidentified Judge 1 : @(In-court) This is the state of Ohio vs . Ryan K. Widmer. @!MURPHY: @(Voiceover) His family and friends were devastated . @(People-in-hallway) @!Ms-WIDMER: Ryan and I were both so brokenhearted . I could not have ever conceived , nor could Ryan , that they would 've had any idea that he would 've been the person to hurt her and that it was n't just a tragic accident . @!Ms-KIST: It just broke my heart . I mean , just knowing that he was feeling that grief and fear for his own life , too . @!MURPHY: Is there any moment when you think , ' Maybe I do n't know the guy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this ... ' @!Mr-KIST: Never . @!MURPHY: ' ... this instant of something awful happen . ' @!Mr-KIST: Never . I 've never even seen anything where he 's remotely angry . @!MURPHY: @(Voiceover) Even Sarah 's family was behind Ryan . So much so the two families decided to delay Sarah 's funeral until Ryan was out on bond . @(People-in-hallway) @!Ms-WIDMER: Sarah 's family , they were very livid about the fact that , you know , he was n't guilty and that they were not going to go forward with the service until Ryan could be there . @!MURPHY: The families are both on the same page here . @!Ms-WIDMER: Yes . @!MURPHY: That you 're foursquare behind Ryan . @!Ms-WIDMER: Mm-hmm . @!MURPHY: And you 're not even going to grieve together formally until he is there with you . @!Ms-WIDMER: Right . @!MURPHY: @(Voiceover) The dead woman 's brother , Mike Steward , asked the judge to lower Ryan 's bond amount so he could attend the funeral . @(Court-in-session) @!Mr-MIKE-STEWARD: @(In-court) In our heart of hearts , we do n't believe Ryan did this . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lowered Ryan 's bond from a million dollars to 400,000 . But by then it was too late . The funeral had already been held so out of town relatives could return home . @(Ryan-exiting-court @!Ms-KIST: @(Voiceover) It was a nice ceremony . Her brother got up and said a few nice words . @(Headstone) @!Ms-KIST: And I know that Ryan wrote a letter that was read during the service . @(Voiceover) The minister that did their wedding , did her funeral , as well . @(Headstone) @!MURPHY: @(Voiceover) Chris and Dana grieved for Sarah , but also tried to comfort a shattered Ryan . @(Headstone) @!Ms-KIST: And I remember him telling me , ' Dana , I love her so much . ' @!MURPHY: @(Voiceover) Ryan was so distraught he felt he could n't go back to the home he 'd bought with Sarah . So while he waited for his trial date , he moved in with his mother . @(Houses; -windows ; -p @!Ms-WIDMER: It was great to have him staying with me , but ... @!MURPHY: There 's only one topic in the household , huh ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to talk about how much we missed Sarah , trying to grieve for her . But at the same time , this young man who lost the love of his life , he 's trying to grieve for his wife and he 's got a murder charge hanging over his head that he might go to prison for the rest of his life . @!MURPHY: @(Voiceover) Ryan Widmer wondered , why could n't everyone just see that he loved his wife and that she died a death that perhaps even a medical examiner could never satisfactorily explain but that it was n't murder ? @(Photos-of-Ryan-and @!HOLT: @(Voiceover) Coming up , the case goes to court , and out comes the evidence . @(People-walking-on- Unidentified Woman 1 : @(In-court) It would be virtually impossible for somebody to fall asleep and not wake up . @!HOLT: @(Voiceover) And later , Ryan Widmer 's only television interview . @(Water-dripping; @!MURPHY: So you think they wanted to make a case here . @!Mr-WIDMER: Why would they arrest me a day after if they did n't want to make a case ? @!HOLT: @(Voiceover) When The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wonderful . @(Photo-of-Sarah-and @!Ms-KIST: The most loving person . She was just a great person . @!MURPHY: @(Voiceover) Sarah Widmer had been a daughter , a wife , a loyal friend in her brief life . But in death , to those who would never know her , she had become simply " the victim . " And the case could be summarized as breezily as the title of a true crime paperback , " The Bathtub Murder . " @(Photos-of-Ryan-and @!MURPHY: @(Voiceover) On talk radio in the greater Cincinnati area , host Bill Cunningham could feel the court of public opinion responding to the story . The Bathtub Murder case had the phones ringing . @(Bill-Cunningham-on @!Mr-BILL-CUNNINGHAM: The idea that such a young man could be watching a Bengals game and within a few seconds turn from a Bengals fan , long suffering , to a murderer was a little bit shocking . @!MURPHY: @(Voiceover) For months listeners debated whether the husband could have done it . @(Audio-levels-mixe @!Mr-CUNNINGHAM: I had a large number of callers who said to me , ' He did n't do it . He does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And I said to them , ' Wait a minute . Wait till the trial takes place . I 'm led to believe that there 's going to be clear and convincing evidence . ' @!MURPHY: @(Voiceover) Seven months after Sarah 's death , the only jury that mattered was sworn in to hear the case against 28-year-old Ryan Widmer , a charge of aggravated murder . The couple 's friends were sticking by him . @(People-walking-on- @!Mr-KIST: Basically his life hangs in the balance of those 12 jurors. @!Ms-KIST: That 's a scary thought . @!Mr-KIST: It is a scary thought . @!Ms-KIST: As far as his ... @!Mr-KIST: There is a chance that he could go to jail . @!MURPHY: @(Voiceover) In the courtroom , Sarah 's family sat across the room from Ryan 's , much as they had the previous year during the couple 's fairy-tale wedding . But now Sarah 's family 's support for him had eroded . For Ryan 's mom that was just another unexpected twist in a situation that seemed to get stranger by the minute . Her son on trial for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is what I see . @(Ryan-in-court) @!Ms-WIDMER: I mean , he was scared to death . @!MURPHY: @(Voiceover) But the prosecution 's message for the jury was blunt . There had been a violent confrontation in the Widmer house that night . @(Court-in-session) @!Mr-TRAVIS-VIEUX: @(In-court) Ryan Widmer purposely killed Sarah Steward Widmer and murdered her by drowning . @!MURPHY: @(Voiceover) The prosecutors began with the first moments of the case , Ryan 's call to 911. @(Court-in-session) @!Mr-WIDMER: @(911-audiotape) My wife , she fell asleep in the bathtub , I think . I was downstairs . I just came up here , and she was laying facedown in the bathtub. @!MURPHY: @(Voiceover) On the stand , the emergency dispatcher testified that the voice on the phone that night was giving more details than normal . @(Court-in-session) 911 Operator : @(In-court) It seemed that the caller was rather calm . Usually we -- I ca n't get , you know , anything out of them . @(911-audiotape) She 's in the bathtub ? @!Mr-WIDMER: @(911-audiotape) Yes , she 's -- the water is draining right now . I was downstairs watching TV @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . @!MURPHY: @(Voiceover) To prosecutors John Arnold and Travis Vieux , he was trying to place himself as far away as possible from the bathroom where Sarah had died . @(Court-in-session; @!Mr-VIEUX: He really gives very little information about her condition . It 's really more important for him to say , ' I was n't there and I really do n't have anything to do with this . ' @!MURPHY: @(Voiceover) And could Sarah even be dead facedown in the bathtub ? Could a body contort that way ? @(Bathtub; @!Mr-JOHN-ARNOLD: That seems an odd position for somebody who 's put -- fallen asleep to be facedown with your face near the faucet , almost bent in two . @!Mr-VIEUX: In terms of the possibilities of how the enclosed space of a bathtub is shorter than she is long . @!MURPHY: We 're not talking about a McMansion whirlpool tub here , are we ? @!Mr-VIEUX: Right . @!MURPHY: @(Voiceover) And so much more of the prosecution case was built upon the observation of the first arriving officers and emergency responders . They noted not only was Ryan not wet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the tub just minutes before they arrived , Sarah was also mostly dry . @(Court-in-session; - Unidentified Police Officer 1 : @(In-court) I noticed that her body was dry , her hair was damp . @!MURPHY: @(Voiceover) And others on the scene corroborated this observation : damp head , dry body . @(Photo-of-bathroom) Unidentified Woman 2 : @(In-court) Things were not adding up . It would seem to me her body would have been wet , the floor would have been wet , the carpet would have been wet . @!Mr-VIEUX: You 're talking about from the time he says , ' I 'm taking her out of this bathtub , to the time that other people are there , her hair is described as simply damp , not even wet . The carpet 's not wet . There 's not water dripping off of her hair onto the rest of her body . The floor 's not wet . @!MURPHY: @(Voiceover) And this officer noticed something else , the victim 's fingers and toes . We all know what happens to them when they 've been soaking in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understanding that she 'd been in the water for 20 to 30 minutes , and I would have thought that her fingers would have been pruned up , her toes would have been pruned up . @!Mr-ARNOLD: @(In-court) And did you see any indication of that ? Woman 2 : @(In-court) No. @!MURPHY: From simple observations , the murder case had grown . The jury was being told that Ryan Widmer 's story did n't jive with what officers on the scene had taken note of , like the bathtub and surrounding tiles that should have been soaking wet but were n't . And that implicitly raised a question for the jury : Is it possible that this young woman who drowned had never been in the tub in the first place ? @!Mr-ARNOLD: Bottom line is there would have been water everywhere . If there was n't , it was cleaned up . And if there was a cleanup , then there was something to hide . And that was her murder . @!MURPHY: @(Voiceover) And an expert witness for the prosecution spoke to the issue of whether a person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her testimony was , no , that ca n't happen . @(Court-in-session; - Woman 1 : @(In-court) It would be virtually impossible for somebody , without the influence of drugs or alcohol or something external , to fall asleep and not wake up . So , first , the sensation of water on your face would wake you up . Two , it would be the gag reflex , water entering your airway , just choking . And then , three , if for some reason that did n't , the drop in oxygen would actually cause you to stimulate and wake up . @!MURPHY: @(Voiceover) But maybe Sarah had n't fallen asleep . Perhaps she 'd suffered a catastrophic but perfectly natural event , something to her heart , her brain . The coroner did n't find that . @(Sarah-and-Ryan-on- @!Mr-ARNOLD: @(In-court) Any evidence of heart problems ? Unidentified Man 1 : @(In-court) No. @!Mr-ARNOLD: @(In-court) Any evidence of brain injury or seizure ? Man 1 : @(In-court) No. @!Mr-VIEUX: One of the amazing things about Sarah Widmer is that she had regular medical care . For a person her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a regular physical . This is not a person who did n't have the opportunity to interact with her medical professionals . @!MURPHY: @(Voiceover) And to the coroner , the bruising he saw on Sarah 's neck and scalp while performing the autopsy looked ominous , the wounds too significant and not in the right spot to have been caused by EMTs life-saving efforts . @(Autopsy-report; -co Man 1 : @(In-court) But the things that were the most disconcerting were , you know , the three bruises which were able to be seen on the right side of the scalp . She 's got another faint bruise on her forehead . She 's got this significant degree of a neck hemorrhage . She 's undergone significant CPR . However , there is no hemorrhage anywhere in the area of the chest . So it 's difficult to try to rationalize that the hemorrhage in her neck can be the result of CPR. @!MURPHY: @(Voiceover) As the coroner saw it , the significant bruising on Sarah 's neck was caused by Ryan 's forceful drowning of her . @(Autopsy-report) @!Mr-ARNOLD: @(In-court) Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's death ? Man 1 : @(In-court) Yes . The manner of death was homicide . @!MURPHY: @(Voiceover) And that took prosecutors into the realm of speculation . What had happened in the bedroom that night if Sarah had n't drowned by herself in the bathtub ? This forensic pathologist had one scenario explaining a damp head but dry body . @(Man-on-witness-sta Unidentified Man 2 : @(In-court) Her head was pushed over the edge of either the bathtub or the sink or the toilet , either forwards or backwards , either in a pool of water or under running water . That 's how she died . @!MURPHY: @(Voiceover) An expert also noted these strange prints , invisible to the naked eye . He could n't say when they were left on the tub , or even that they came from Sarah , but felt confident that the prints were most likely made by a small person . If Ryan had forced Sarah over the side of the tub , had she tried to brace herself as she was pushed into the water ? @(Ryan-in-court; -mar Unidentified Man 3 : @(In-court) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down in a downward motion . @!Mr-ARNOLD: How do you fight back ? Do you try to keep your head out of the water ? Do you put your hands against the back of the tub , or do you put your hands on the bottom of the tub and try to lift out of the water , or do you grasp and -- at somebody and lose your only hold on life ? @!MURPHY: @(Voiceover) A stark image . The husband pushing his wife 's head underwater and holding her there until she drowned . @(Photo-of-Ryan-and- @!Mr-ARNOLD: This was a drowning . She had been subjected to forcibly holding her throat over some object to drown her . @!MURPHY: @(Voiceover) But the jury had to wonder what the motivation could be for such an awful crime . Sarah 's mother , who had initially supported Ryan , was now testifying for the prosecution . She said that when she was out shopping with Sarah , her daughter seemed to feel she needed to check everything with Ryan , who could see her purchases on his computer . @(Court-in-session; - Sarah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ryan would call her as soon as she bought it , sometimes , telling her , ' Did you really need it ? Why did you buy it ? or something . He thought she was spending too much money . @!MURPHY: He was very concerned about her shopping habits . @!Mr-VIEUX: Correct . There were still stresses , things that were going on in their family . @!MURPHY: @(Voiceover) But even the prosecutors had to acknowledge that this did n't necessarily add up to a clear motive for murder . But they believed there were things happening in the little house at Crested Owl Court that no one but Sarah or Ryan knew about . @(Photo-of-Ryan-and- @!Mr-ARNOLD: Anybody who 's been married or in a relationship knows that what goes on behind the closed doors of a marriage is not always apparent to the outside . @!MURPHY: @(Voiceover) But was the prosecution 's case too thin , too much observationlike with not enough persuasive hard evidence ? The defense would argue passionately that it was and that Ryan had nothing to do with his wife 's sudden death . @(Ryan-in-court; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 27 years , who has never even shown anger in his entire life , would all of a sudden ... @(Voiceover) ... kill his wife . @(Ryan-in-court) @!HOLT: @(Voiceover) Coming up , Ryan 's side of the story . Sarah 's friends take the stand . @(Ryan-in-court; -peo Unidentified Woman 3 : @(In-court) I know that she had fallen asleep in the bathtub before . @!HOLT: @(Voiceover) When The Bathtub Mystery continues . @(Title-graphic) @(Announcements) @!MURPHY: @(Voiceover) What was the toughest thing you had to surmount ? @(Title-graphic; @!Mr-RITTGERS: @(Voiceover) That we had a lovely 24-year-old woman who was dead ... @(Photo-of-Ryan-and- @!Mr-RITTGERS: ... and no one could explain why . @!MURPHY: @(Voiceover) The defense was n't going to be able to tell the jury what caused Sarah Widmer to drown that night , but they were going to show that Ryan Widmer had no reason to hurt his wife . And as far as damp hair , dry body , they 'd explain that . The bottom line for the defense ... @(Photo-of-Sarah; @!Mr-RITTGERS: @(In-court) I know one thing , Ryan Widmer had nothing to do with his wife 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defense attorney , argued that his client was plagued from the get-go by his unhappy choice of words on that 911 call . @(Rittgers-in-court; 911 Operator : @(911-audiotape) Is she still in the bathtub ? @!Mr-WIDMER: @(911-audiotape) Yes , she falls asleep in the tub all the time . It 's ... @!MURPHY: Electing to say she fell asleep in the tub sets the alarms going . @!Mr-RITTGERS: Exactly . @!MURPHY: @(Voiceover) In other words , had Ryan told the 911 dispatcher only that his wife was unconscious , it would n't have been so suspicious . @(Bathtub) @!Mr-RITTGERS: @(In-court) The only thing Ryan knows is she fell asleep in the tub . But they jump on that and say he 's a liar . @!MURPHY: @(Voiceover) The defense attorney argued the coroner had been all too quick to rule the death a homicide ... @(Court-in-session; @!Mr-RITTGERS: He had no idea ... @(Voiceover) ... she had unusual sleep habits . He had no idea that ... @(Home-video-of-Sara @!Mr-RITTGERS: ... she was suffering from a headache that day . @!MURPHY: @(Voiceover) Remember , an expert witness for the prosecution had said it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ die in the tub . But those who knew her sleep habits said it may have been a sign of an undiagnosed , underlying medical condition . Sarah 's boss , the dentist , testified that her quirky sleep habits were well known around the office . @(Photo-of-Ryan-and- Unidentified Man 4 : @(In-court) She would normally grab a quick lunch and then go out to her car and take a nap for 30 or 45 minutes . It was odd because people do n't generally do that . @!MURPHY: @(Voiceover) And the dentist recollected that Sarah had n't been feeling well on that last day of her life . @(Photo-of-Sarah) Man 4 : @(In-court) She had a sore throat , her stomach had been bothering her earlier in the day . @!MURPHY: @(Voiceover) She was still feeling crummy later that evening when she spoke to a friend . @(Window-at-night) Unidentified Woman 4 : @(In-court) She had a headache , and the back of her neck was hurting . I mean , she sounded tired and , you know , she 's -- she did n't sound like she felt very good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her bathtub , that sounded just like the Sarah they knew . @(Bathtub; @!Mr-KIST: @(Voiceover) She would always leave our house and say she had to get home ... @(Photo-of-Sarah) @!Mr-KIST: ... because she had to take her bath . @!MURPHY: @(Voiceover) And Sarah dozing off in the tub was a trait a friend from childhood days was very familiar with . @(Water-dripping-fro Woman 3 : @(In-court) She had fallen asleep in the bathtub before . @!Mr-RITTGERS: @(In-court) OK . Woman 3 : @(In-court) We had talked about that because I had fallen asleep in the bathtub before , too . @!MURPHY: The sleeping habits , the headaches , the defense claimed they could very well have been the symptoms of an underlying and potentially fatal condition that went undetected , something an otherwise healthy young woman would n't take all that seriously . And even with all their scientific art , argued the defense , sometimes pathologists simply can not say why a person died . @(Voiceover) A doctor who specializes in emergency medicine testified that unexplained deaths occur far more often than many of us would guess . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approximately 300,000 episodes of sudden death per year . And of those episodes of sudden death , 1 to 2 percent occur in young people . But one-third of those young people that die have normal autopsies. @!MURPHY: @(Voiceover) In other words , people sometimes just die and their autopsies may never reveal the cause . But the issue that might decide the case was the observation by the arriving officers and EMTs of damp hair and dry body . What looked suspicious was easily explainable , said the defense . Hair simply stays wet longer . @(Emergency-room; @!Mr-RITTGERS: @(In-court) If they get out of a swimming pool or a bathtub , their skin dries before their hair ? Unidentified Man 6 : @(In-court) Yes . @!MURPHY: @(Voiceover) The defense told the court you have to look at the clock , the elapsed time of the incident . The defense claimed that Sarah 's body dried off in the time between Ryan first speaking to the 911 dispatcher and when the police officer arrived . And what about the fingers and toes that should have been pruned up but were n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the tub . @(Court-in-session; @!Mr-RITTGERS: @(In-court) We do n't know if she was primping in front of the mirror . We do n't know any of that stuff . @!MURPHY: @(Voiceover) And , by the way , suggested the defense , you ca n't have it both ways with the dry bathroom theory . If Ryan had killed Sarah in the small bathroom , there also should have been water splashed everywhere . @(Bedroom; -bathroom ; @!Mr-RITTGERS: If there was a violent struggle , then there would be water on the floor , on the counter , on the walls , everywhere . And if they want to claim that it was a staged scene where he cleaned up the water , well , where 's the wet towel ? @!MURPHY: @(Voiceover) And investigators looked for wet towels in the dryer , even in the garage . Nothing . And say for argument 's sake there had been a struggle . You 'd think Ryan would have gotten scratched up as Sarah fought for her life , but Ryan did n't have a mark on him . @(Bathtub; @!MURPHY: @(Voiceover) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attacked ? @(Photo-of-Ryan; @!Ms-WIDMER: @(Voiceover) Sarah was a very spunky person . @(Photo-of-Ryan-and- @!Ms-WIDMER: And she was small in stature , probably 5 ' 1 " . I think she weighed around 140 pounds . But she was n't frail by any stretch of the imagination . She was a strong girl . @!MURPHY: So she would have gone for her attacker ? @!Ms-WIDMER: I full heartedly believe , yes . @!MURPHY: @(Voiceover) And Sarah 's French manicure was in pristine condition when the EMTs found her . No sign of a fight . @(Autopsy-photo) Unidentified Man 7 : @(In-court) There was absolutely no damage to the nail . @!Ms-WIDMER: She had ... @(Voiceover) ... beautiful French manicured nails . @(Photo-of-Sarah) @!Ms-WIDMER: None of them were damaged at all . @(Voiceover) She did n't have skin from Ryan underneath her . @(Photo-of-Ryan-and- @!MURPHY: @(Voiceover) And the very notion of Ryan attacking Sarah is preposterous , say their friends . @(Photo-of-Ryan-and- @!Ms-KIST: @(Voiceover) Ryan 's a lot like my husband , Chris ... @(Photo-of-Ryan-and- @!Ms-KIST: ... in the aspect of , you know , when there 's an argument , Chris just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fix it ? And let 's move on . And that 's kind of how Ryan was . @!MURPHY: @(Voiceover) And as far as accounting for the bruising noted to her neck and scalp , to the defense , they were certainly caused by the EMTs working on Sarah . @(Autopsy-report; @!Mr-RITTGERS: @(Voiceover) Talking about 45 minutes of resuscitation efforts . @(Flashing-lights; @!Mr-RITTGERS: Not five , not 10 ; 45 minutes . @!MURPHY: @(Voiceover) It looked perfectly consistent to this emergency room doctor , an expert for the defense . @(Emergency-room) Man 5 : @(In-court) I was not surprised at the injuries at all based on the prolonged CPR and the number of intubation attempts . @!MURPHY: @(Voiceover) Add it all up -- injuries the result of life-saving efforts , skin that may well have dried before the authorities showed up -- and you were left , the defense argued , with an unexplained death , something that experts tell you happens . And , jurors , the reason you did n't hear about love affairs or out of control finances is because none of those things existed . @(Autopsy-report; @!Mr-RITTGERS: @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It did n't add up that this man of 27 years who has never even shown anger in his entire life ... @(Rittgers-in-court; @!Mr-RITTGERS: ... would all of a sudden kill his wife . It made no sense . @(In-court) I hope that you 'll agree that Ryan Widmer is not guilty of any wrongdoing . @!TEXT: Join the Discussion facebook.com/datelinenbc @!MURPHY: @(Voiceover) But the prosecution would tell the jury in its closing argument that while they may never know why Ryan killed his wife of only four months , that he nonetheless did , and that the clock was ticking as he staged the scene before he called 911 . That , they said , explains the damp hair and dry body mystery . @(Court-in-session; @!Mr-VIEUX: @(In-court) Sarah Widmer was either out of that bathtub for a longer period of time , had been dead for a longer period of time , or her body was never fully in that bathtub. @!MURPHY: @(Voiceover) And they claimed that Ryan spent so much time cleaning up the scene before he called for EMTs that Sarah 's dead body was showing signs of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was already dead by the time they got there . They had difficulty intubating her because her chin kept wanting to fall , rigor mortis was setting in. @!MURPHY: @(Voiceover) Now it was up to the jury to decide if Ryan Widmer had killed his wife . @(Photo-of-Ryan-and- @!HOLT: @(Voiceover) Coming up ... @(Coming-up-graphic) @!Ms-KIST: @(Voiceover) We 're scared ... @(Jury-room-door) @!Ms-KIST: ... that the truth may not come out .

The verdict and the controversy when The Bathtub Mystery continues . @(Courthouse; @(Announcements) @!MURPHY: @(Voiceover) About the only fact of the case that was indisputable was that Sarah Widmer had drowned . But was it a natural death in her bathtub ? @(Title-graphic; @!MURPHY: What about the suggestion of a neurological event , something with the heart that the medical examiner could not find ? @!Mr-VIEUX: Her medical history is completely devoid of anything that even would suggest these things . @!MURPHY: @(Voiceover) Or had Sarah died at the hands of her husband Ryan ? @(Photo-of-Ryan-and- @!Mr-RITTGERS: They had failed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Inside the Warren County Courthouse , the jury was out all day .

She was cautiously optimistic . @(Jill-looking-at-ph @!Ms-WIDMER: @(Voiceover) I never let myself get cocky , like just felt that in having sat there and listened that there were a lot of holes and not a lot of evidence . @(Jill-looking-at-ph @!Ms-WIDMER: Never felt like it was a slam dunk , but I felt like there was a lot or reasonable doubt . @!MURPHY: @(Voiceover) The jurors were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sarah had been found dead to be brought to them in the jury room . By the second day , Ryan 's defense attorney was getting anxious . @(Bathtub; @!MURPHY: When they 're out more than 20 hours , it 's clear that somebody 's saying that this is n't as straightforward as it seems . @!Mr-RITTGERS: Correct . @!MURPHY: @(Voiceover) But the prosecutors were n't worried by the long jury deliberation . @(Empty-jury-room) @!Mr-ARNOLD: We knew it was going to be a hard case for them to weigh a lot of evidence . @!MURPHY: @(Voiceover) They had two counts to decide . Count one , aggravated murder . Did Ryan premeditate the murder of his wife , Sarah ? And count two , nonpremeditated murder . Did it happen suddenly , without prior thought ? Finally , after 23 hours , the jurors had reached a verdict . The lawyers were summoned . @(Jury-room-door; @!Mr-RITTGERS: @(Voiceover) It 's a very traumatic moment . Your heart is racing , it 's in your throat and you 're anxious to hear ... @(Court-in-session) @!Mr-RITTGERS: ... what the jury says .

She saw that as an ominous sign . @(Rain-and-branch-mo @!Ms-WIDMER: @(Voiceover) The skies just opened up . There were tornado warnings . @(Rain) @!Ms-WIDMER: And it all just culminated when the verdict was about ready to be read . @!MURPHY: @(Voiceover) Ryan Widmer took his place at the defense table . @(Ryan-Rittgers-in- Judge 1 : @(In-court) The defendant will please rise . The verdict on count one , aggravated murder , " We the jury find the defendant Ryan K. Widmer is not guilty of aggravated murder . " @!MURPHY: @(Voiceover) It was a moment of relief for Ryan Widmer . The jury did not believe that he killed his wife with premeditation . But he still faced the second count of murder . @(Ryan-in-court) Judge 1 : @(In-court) The verdict reads , " We , the jury in this case , find the defendant Ryan K. Widmer is guilty of the lesser included offense of murder . " @!MURPHY: @(Voiceover) Guilty . The jury had decided that Ryan Widmer did , indeed , murder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @(In-court) Mr. Widmer , is there anything that you wish to say ? @!MURPHY: @(Voiceover) The accused , now the convicted , would kiss his wedding ring and then address the court for the first time . He had n't taken the stand , as was his right . @(Court-in-session) @!Mr-WIDMER: @(In-court) I loved my wife . I did not hurt her . I was never given a chance . The day after she passes away , they charge me with murder . I did n't -- if I had an answer I would give the answer to what happened to her . But I ca n't . I was not in the bathroom with her . @!Mr-RITTGERS: @(Voiceover) He was very upset . He doubled over when addressing the court . In fact , I was surprised that he was as outspoken as he was . @(Ryan-Rittgers-in- @!Mr-RITTGERS: But he indicated to the judge and everybody that he loved Sarah ... @(Voiceover) ... and he would never have hurt her . @(Ryan-and-Rittgers- @!Mr-WIDMER: @(In-court) I love my wife and I did not hurt her . @!MURPHY: @(Voiceover) Ryan Widmer was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prison .

One of my best friends . @!MURPHY: So there is n't a whisper of doubt that says , ' My best friend may have been killed by this ... ' @!Ms-KIST: Absolutely not . @!MURPHY: As close as you were to her , you still defend him ? @!Ms-KIST: I do . @!MURPHY: @(Voiceover) Ryan 's attorney took the loss personally . @(Rittgers-in-court) @!Mr-RITTGERS: It was awful . Yeah , this is -- it was on my shoulders . It was my duty to my client to get a proper verdict , and I failed . @!MURPHY: @(Voiceover) But as Ryan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't the end of The Bathtub Murder case . The fax machine in the defense lawyer 's office began to spit out other shocking information . The case of Ryan Widmer was far , far from over . @(Ryan-escorted-in-h @!MURPHY: As we speak , it is n't the end of things . @!Mr-RITTGERS: That 's correct . @!HOLT: @(Voiceover) Coming up , something amiss in the jury room . @(Jury-room) @!Mr-RITTGERS: He said that two or three of the female jurors had done home experiments where they had showered and then air dried . @!HOLT: @(Voiceover) Home experiments ? What was that all about ? Ryan Widmer was about to get a break , when The Bathtub Mystery continues . @(Photo-of-Sarah-and @(Announcements) @!HOLT: Ryan Widmer just got the shock of his life . He 's been found guilty of murder . Jurors agreed with prosecutors that he 'd deliberately drowned his wife in their bathroom upstairs then claimed it was an accident . But many still believe it really was an accident . Did the jury get it wrong ? Later we 'll hear from Ryan Widmer himself in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . here again is Dennis Murphy . @!Mr-RITTGERS: My impression was that the community was stunned by the verdict . @!MURPHY: @(Voiceover) The verdict was so unpopular in the court of public opinion that candlelight vigils were staged to protest the jury vote . @(Candlelight-vigil) @!Mr-CUNNINGHAM: @(Voiceover) There has never been a case where hundreds of Americans come out of their homes carrying candlelights to listen to prayers about a condemned , convicted killer . @(Candlelight-vigil) @!Mr-CUNNINGHAM: It 's never happened before . @!MURPHY: @(Voiceover) Talk radio host Bill Cunningham , a lawyer by training , regards himself as a hang ' em high conservative , but even felt this was a case of justice denied . @(Cunningham-in-stud @!Mr-CUNNINGHAM: Judging this case against a hundred other murder trials , this is one of the flimsiest and one of the weakest I 've ever seen . @!Mr-MIKE-MAYLEBEN: ( Into microphone ) My name is Mike Mayleben . I 'm the creator of the website and ... @!MURPHY: @(Voiceover) Someone out there following the trial was Mike Mayleben , a young newlywed himself and a Web page designer . Even though he 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he launched a FreeRyanWidmer website. @(Mike-Mayleben-spea @!Mr-MAYLEBEN: @(Voiceover) The goal is for him to get a new trial . If he does n't get a new trial ... @(Website) @!Mr-MAYLEBEN: ... I believe it 's going to outrage a lot of people . @!MURPHY: @(Voiceover) Angry citizens , taxpayers , voters . Even though the real trial was over , the prosecution had n't entirely called it quits . In their post-verdict victory lap , they spoke of things that the judge had not allowed the jury hear . The weekend before his wife died , when she 'd been away visiting relatives , they say Ryan had frequented a website called Adult FriendFinder , an organization that bills itself as the world 's largest site for swingers. @(Rally; @!Det-BRALEY: @(Voiceover) We found evidence that he 'd been on the site but no evidence that he followed through . @(Web-page) @!Det-BRALEY: If they were such a happy couple , why is somebody on the computer surfing , looking for a hookup spot ? That makes no sense to me. @(Voiceover) That would combat the idea of the happy couple . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surfing or other pornography investigators say they found on his computer to be introduced as evidence , since there was no way to know if Sarah even knew about Ryan 's Internet trolling . Still , was it a sign , as the detective thought , that their marriage was not as happy as friends and family believed ? @(Web-page; @!Ms-WIDMER: My understanding of some of these sites , supposedly , that he visited ended up being pop-ups on a computer and -- well , I 'm not the most computer literate person , but I do n't think the full story was told there either . And I do n't understand if they got the verdict they want why they have to continue to attack my son and my family . @!MURPHY: @(Voiceover) And Ryan 's mother says if the couple had fought over anything , the family would have known . Sarah , always outspoken , was n't the type to suffer in silence . @(Photos-of-Sarah-an @!Ms-WIDMER: @(Voiceover) Sarah told everybody everything . She 's a chatty person . She had just been with her family for an entire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were any problems , believe me they all would have known it , and I probably would have known it because Sarah would have probably called and yelled at me about something my son was doing that was n't nice to her . @!MURPHY: @(Voiceover) But none of that mattered now . The jury had spoken and defense lawyer Rittgers still could n't get over the guilty verdict . Ryan had become more than a client to him . @(Rittgers-speaking- @!Mr-RITTGERS: @(Voiceover) I absolutely believed in him . I had him to my home . @(Rittgers-speaking- @!Mr-RITTGERS: I had him around my wife and my kids . There was no question in my mind he was innocent . Innocent . @!MURPHY: @(Voiceover) Rittgers did what lawyers often do after losing a case . He wrote a motion to have the judge let Ryan go free or order a new trial . A long shot . Ryan was in prison and would likely stay there . @(Court-building; @!Ms-WIDMER: This has been a roller coaster ride and I just ca n't let myself get my hopes up . @!MURPHY: He may be in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And this appeal process , it , I mean , it can take forever . @!MURPHY: @(Voiceover) The day after defense attorney Rittgers filed his motion , his fax machine started humming . It was a letter from a juror. @(Rittgers-and-repor @!Mr-RITTGERS: @(Voiceover) He was having problems living with himself . He said it was a moral dilemma for him to allow it just to go without ... @(Jury-room) @!Mr-RITTGERS: ... bringing it up to somebody 's attention . @!MURPHY: @(Voiceover) The juror claimed there had been forbidden monkey business during deliberations . Monkey business over nothing less than the biggest issue in the trial : damp head , dry body . @(Jury-room) @!Mr-RITTGERS: He said that two or three of the female jurors had done home experiments where they had showered and then air dried . @!MURPHY: They were testing out this theory of how quickly the body dries ... @!Mr-RITTGERS: That 's correct . @!MURPHY: ... coming out of the tub or shower ? @!Mr-RITTGERS: Yes . @!MURPHY: At home ? @!Mr-RITTGERS: At home . @!MURPHY: If the faxing juror was correct , the panel had directly violated the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in court . The allegation was jury misconduct , a serious matter . @(Voiceover) Attorney Mark Godsey runs the Ohio Innocence Project . He saw the juror letter as a way to persuade the judge to grant Ryan a new trial . @(Mark-Godsey-workin @!Mr-MARK-GODSEY: It 's unusual for a juror to come forward and reveal that the jurors had violated the rules and they had performed experiments and brought that into the deliberations. @!MURPHY: @(Voiceover) The judge began reviewing affidavits from the jurors about just want went on during deliberations . In one of those sworn statements , a juror said of those taboo home experiments " the times to air dry influenced my decision . " @(Documents) @!Mr-GODSEY: Jurors are not supposed to go home and do experiments . @!MURPHY: @(Voiceover) In the end , the judge agreed . Four months after Ryan Widmer 's conviction , he ruled that the husband would get another trial . The not guilty verdict on the aggravated murder count , however , would remain . So the prosecution could only retry him on the second count of unpremeditated murder . His mother scraped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Ryan was released from prison , but by then he 'd already spent five months behind bars . @(Judge; -documents ; - @!MURPHY: @(Voiceover) The quest for justice can deplete both bank accounts and emotions . @(Jill-looking-out-w @!Ms-WIDMER: Yes . @!MURPHY: How far are you prepared to go in this ? @!Ms-WIDMER: I 'm prepared to go towards -- till the day I die . If I have to live on the street in a cardboard box at the end of this , I 'm going to do whatever it takes to get my son out of this . @!MURPHY: @(Voiceover) And Ryan and his family would end up not only at the very brink of financial bankruptcy but also at the edge of emotional collapse . @(Jill-looking-at-ph @!Ms-KIST: @(Voiceover) He says he ca n't sleep . He says he sees her when he closes his eyes . @(Photo-of-Sarah-and @!Mr-KIST: He misses her . He still wears the wedding ring . @!MURPHY: @(Voiceover) Everything in Ryan 's life was spiraling downward . He 'd lost his job as a sports planner after the guilty verdict and was left to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bought together went into foreclosure . And now another jury would be asked to peer inside the mystery of a marriage and decide what exactly happened behind those closed doors on Crested Owl Court . The prosecutors would have to convince another jury that Ryan Widmer had killed his wife . @(Photos-of-Ryan; @!MURPHY: And it 's got to be hugely frustrating . You got a guilty verdict , then you got to do it again . @!Mr-ARNOLD: On the other hand , by that point , we knew how a jury would react to our evidence . @!MURPHY: On the other side of the coin , the defense has seen your case . @!Mr-ARNOLD: They certainly have . @!Mr-VIEUX: Yeah . @!MURPHY: And they can now counterpunch it . @!Mr-ARNOLD: And we ca n't change it very much . @!MURPHY: @(Voiceover) Ryan Widmer trial , take two . @(Court-in-session) @!HOLT: Coming up , a new jury makes a dramatic return to the scene of the drowning . @(Voiceover) And later , Ryan Widmer tells his own story . @(Ryan-walking-out-d @!Mr-WIDMER: I 'm going to -- fighting this until it 's made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @(Announcements) @!MURPHY: @(Voiceover) A little more than a year after a jury had found Ryan Widmer guilty of murder , only to have the verdict thrown out , it would start all over again . This time a new defense team would take over Ryan 's case . Defense lawyers Jay Clark and Lindsey Gutierrez worried that , even though they were starting the trial with a clean slate of jurors , the verdict from the first trial would still hang over the accused . @(Ryan-walking-throu @!Ms-LINDSEY-GUTIERR: While he 's still innocent until proven guilty , everyone thinks and everyone knows , well , he was proven guilty . @!MURPHY: @(Voiceover) Across the courtroom , the prosecution team was the same , and it would hammer home the argument that a healthy 24-year-old woman just does not die alone in a bathtub. @(Court-in-session; @!Mr-ARNOLD: @(In-court) Did you see any evidence that Sarah suffered a seizure to cause her death by drowning ? Unidentified Man 8 : @(In-court) No. @!MURPHY: @(Voiceover) Sarah 's body ? Dry to the to the touch the officers and EMTs testified , and the bathroom where her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was also not wet . @(Photo-of-wedding; - Unidentified Police Officer 2 : @(In-court) Towels , a rug , magazines , they all appeared to be dry . @!MURPHY: @(Voiceover) And the jury would again hear the 911 call that to prosecution ears sounded odd . @(Speaker) @!Mr-WIDMER: @(911-audiotape) I was downstairs . I just came up here and she was laying facedown in the bathtub. @!Mr-ARNOLD: @(Voiceover) And the message was ... @(Ryan-in-court) @!Mr-ARNOLD: ... ' My wife 's dead and I was n't around when it happened . ' @!MURPHY: @(Voiceover) But unlike the first trial , the defense lawyers asked to take the jurors to the home where Ryan and Sarah had lived to inspect for themselves the very bathroom where she died . The lawyers had made a pretrial visit . @(Vehicles-in-street @!Mr-JAY-CLARK: The first thing we said was , ' Man , this is small . ' @!MURPHY: @(Voiceover) They wanted the jurors to see for themselves that this was a cramped space in a modest builder 's home . @(Bathroom; -bathtub ) @!Ms-GUTIERREZ: Imagine Ryan at 6 ' 2 " and Sarah about 5 ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them actually interacting in here . @!MURPHY: @(Voiceover) It was such a small bathroom , a defense expert argued , that if there had been a violent struggle , both the husband and wife would have shown more obvious bruises and scratches . @(Witness-in-court; - Unidentified Man 9 : I would have expected to see more injury if a violent struggle had occurred . @!MURPHY: @(Voiceover) But the prosecutors argued that Widmer , in an explosion of anger , could have overtaken his wife so quickly that she would have had no time to fight back . And in their closing arguments , they told the jurors that Ryan Widmer not only killed his wife but also delayed calling 911 to buy time to cover up his crime . @(Bathtub; @!Mr-VIEUX: @(In-court) Things looked so nice because Ryan Widmer had the opportunity to reset the scene . He had time to put things back into place . @!MURPHY: @(Voiceover) But Ryan 's defense lawyers were hopeful this jury would see the case the way they did : an innocent man on trial for a murder he did not commit . @(Court-in-session) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . @!MURPHY: @(Voiceover) The case was given to jury number two , and it seemed as though everyone in Cincinnati was on the edge of their seats waiting for its decision .

And as the jurors left for a long holiday weekend , the specter of a mistrial hung in the air . Dana and Chris Kist once again waited with Ryan . @(People-talking-in- @!Ms-KIST: We have to make sure that he knows we 're here . @!Mr-KIST: Hopeful . @!Ms-KIST: That 's what we do as friends is support him and be hopeful and have the faith that this is going to turn out the way that it 's meant to turn out . @!MURPHY: @(Voiceover) The jury returned to work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fourth day of deliberations , they asked to see the judge again . @(Jury-room; -people- Judge 2 : @(In-court) The note reads , " We have decided that we can not agree and that further deliberations will not serve a useful purpose .

I should be found not guilty . @!MURPHY: @(Voiceover) At a press conference , Ryan 's parents vowed to stand by their son .

And a father who completely believes in his son 's innocence and will do anything to help him . @(Handcuffs; @!GARY: If there 's any avenue to take , you have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take it . @!MURPHY: Your son did n't do it . @!GARY: Mm-hmm . @!MURPHY: Sarah Widmer died for reasons unknown . @!GARY: Yes . @!Mr-MAYLEBEN: ( Into microphone ) Give you guys a round of applause . @!MURPHY: @(Voiceover) And beyond Ryan 's family and close friends standing behind him , it was a case that had galvanized a virtual army . There were Free Ryan Widmer T-shirts and wristbands. @(Rally; -wristband ) @!Mr-KIST: He was getting a lot of support . @!MURPHY: Including an anonymous donor said to have contributed $60,000. @!Mr-KIST: Yeah . @!MURPHY: Stranger . @!Ms-KIST: Yes . @!MURPHY: @(Voiceover) Even the prosecutors were a bit worried . So much taxpayer money would be spent on a third trial , so many Ryan Widmer supporters beating very loud drums . A plea deal was floated . @(Rally; @!Mr-ARNOLD: We felt that it was a subject worth bringing up . @!MURPHY: @(Voiceover) But the Kists said there was no way Ryan was taking a deal . @(Dana-and-Chris-on- @!Ms-KIST: They offered him a plea , which they had n't done in two trials . @!MURPHY: And he turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . @!Ms-KIST: Of course he turned it down . @!Mr-KIST: He said ... @!Ms-KIST: He says , ' I 'm innocent . There 's no way that I would ever take a plea . Why would I admit to something I would never have done , that I did not do ? ' @!MURPHY: @(Voiceover) Ryan Widmer was gambling that the next jury would acquit him , but his roll of the dice was taking its toll not just on him but on his family , as well . Ryan 's mom made headlines when she was stopped for drunk driving . She 's pleaded not guilty to the driving under the influence charge but police say they found two open bottles of vodka in her car . @(Photo-of-Ryan; @!GARY: She broke down . @!MURPHY: Hospitalized. @!GARY: Hospitalized . It 's a terrible toll on her . And I 've lived with it . I -- many times , all the three of us are together and you could just feel her going deeper and deeper into this . @!MURPHY: @(Voiceover) But it seemed for every person that came out to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strongly on the other side that he had deliberately drowned his wife . And one of those people would soon change everything . Ten days after the jury deadlocked , a phone rang in the prosecutor 's office . It was a woman with a hand grenade of a story . @(Rally; -newspaper ; - @!MURPHY: Someone who 's come forward who said , ' This guy confessed to me. ' @!Mr-ARNOLD: We want to find out more about what she has to say and how she knows this . @!MURPHY: @(Voiceover) The prosecutors investigated and came away convinced they had the long missing pieces to the puzzle : both a confession and a motive . And Jay Clark , the defense attorney , would now have to worry overtime about the state 's new bombshell of a witness . @(Outside-house; @!MURPHY: Did you guys know what they had up their sleeve ? @!Ms-GUTIERREZ: No. @!Mr-CLARK: Literally , no. @!MURPHY: @(Voiceover) Because the new witness feared for her life , saying that Ryan Widmer had threatened her , her identity would not be disclosed to the defense team until the beginning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ virtually everyone holding their breath . Who was this person and what did she know ? @(Witness-chair; @!HOLT: Coming up , the mystery witness takes the stand . And what a story she has to tell . @(Jennifer-Crew-ente @!Ms-JENNIFER-CREW: @(In-court) Saw the sadness and the pain and the hurt in her mom 's face . They needed to know the truth . @!HOLT: @(Voiceover) When The Bathtub Mystery continues . @(Title-graphic) @(Announcements) Judge 1 : @(In-court) Mr. Widmer , is there anything that you wish to say ? @!MURPHY: @(Voiceover) The first trial ended in a mistrial , the second with a hung jury . Would this next jury reach a verdict ? These three jurors from the last trial said the prosecutors had failed to convince them that Ryan Widmer had killed his wife . @(Court-in-session; - Unidentified Juror 1 : There is just nothing to prove to me that he had anything to do with her death . @!MURPHY: @(Voiceover) And that the next group of jurors would also not be able to reach a unanimous decision . @(Jury-room) Unidentified Juror 2 : We sat in jury deliberations for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same conclusion was very unlikely . Juror 1 : We really did n't think that another jury would not be deadlocked. @!MURPHY: @(Voiceover) They 'd soon find out . Ryan Widmer 's extraordinary third trial for the murder of his wife was about to start all over again . The prosecutors felt it was their duty to argue their case for Sarah . @(Outside-courthouse @!Mr-ARNOLD: We 're committed to seeing that justice is done for the victim of this case , and that 's what we 've got to think about . @!MURPHY: @(Voiceover) It promised to be a judicial Groundhog Day , repeat testimony from the EMTs and arriving officers at the Widmer home , the oddity of a bathtub drowning victim with a damp head and dry body . A 911 call that to some listeners volunteered too much . And injuries to the wife 's neck and head that spoke to the prosecutors of homicide and not resuscitation. @(Court-in-session; @!Mr-ARNOLD: The facts which came out in this case gave rise to that idea that there had been an assault that occurred which progressed into an incident of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own mother described the couple 's relationship as more tense than she had in the previous trials , telling the court that Ryan and Sarah 's arguments made her very uncomfortable . @(People-entering-co Sarah Widmer 's Mother : @(In-court) They would just call each other names and get hateful with each other . I even told them , I said , ' You guys have to stop . I ca n't take it . ' @!MURPHY: @(Voiceover) But what was really new and stunning was something that had been haunting the defense since they first learned of it the previous summer : the prosecution 's mysterious witness who would testify that Ryan had confessed to the crime . It was a woman named Jennifer Crew from Iowa . It was the first time the defense would get a good look at this person who Ryan had allegedly confessed to . And they were worried . @(Court-in-session; @!Ms-GUTIERREZ: She strolls in wearing a suit with decently done hair , normal makeup . @!MURPHY: @(Voiceover) But how exactly did this woman living 500 miles away from Ryan Widmer come to be involved in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out she 'd watched our coverage on DATELINE of the first trial . That DATELINE segment aired on September 18th , 2009 . After watching the show , she sent Ryan an email through the FreeRyanWidmer website telling him how bad she felt about his plight . @(Crew-in-witness-ch @!Ms-CREW: @(In-court) I felt sorry for Ryan . I asked him what I could do to help him . @!MURPHY: @(Voiceover) Before long the two were in frequent touch . @(Email) @!MURPHY: Struck up an email , texts , and then ultimately a phone relationship ? @!Mr-ARNOLD: Correct . @!MURPHY: @(Voiceover) As the relationship continued , Ryan sent her photos of his dogs and asked her to send him a picture of herself . Initially she sent this one of a friend . She says things got a little racy on the phone . @(Email; @!Ms-CREW: @(In-court) And he told me that he was watching porn in his mom 's basement . @!MURPHY: @(Voiceover) There was even talk of Jennifer visiting Ryan in Ohio for a three-way. @(Hands-on-keyboard) @!Ms-CREW: @(In-court) Ryan asked me to ask my friend and I said I would . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stand was to testify about one phone conversation in particular . One very different than their usual banter . It was October 26th , 2009 . Jennifer said she 'd been asleep when Ryan called . It sounded to her as though he had been drinking . @(Crew-in-court; @!Ms-CREW: @(In-court) He was crying and he was saying , ' I did it , I did it . I killed Sarah . I did it . I thought what he meant was that he did n't do enough to save her life that night . He said , ' No , Jen , listen to me . I did it . ' @!MURPHY: @(Voiceover) She said Ryan told her it had started with a fight between the two of them . @(Photo-of-Sarah-and @!Ms-CREW: @(In-court) Sarah had found out that he had cheated on her when she went away with her mom . He said that they were in the living room and they were arguing about his pornography. @!Mr-ARNOLD: @(In-court) And what happened when she came upstairs ? @!Ms-CREW: @(In-court) She was getting ready for the bath . Ryan said that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do this anymore , being married . Said that Sarah told him that the marriage was over . @!MURPHY: @(Voiceover) Ryan , she testified , then told Sarah ... @(Court-in-session) @!Ms-CREW: @(In-court) ' Nobody leaves me . Nobody ever leaves me , and I mean nobody . ' @!MURPHY: @(Voiceover) That 's when Jennifer Crew says Ryan hit his wife . @(Tile; -bathtub ) @!Ms-CREW: @(In-court) And she fell backwards and hit her head . And he said , ' Jen , I blacked out . I blacked out . ' @!MURPHY: @(Voiceover) But why this story now ? Jennifer Crew waited until almost two weeks after the second jury had deadlocked before coming forward , even though Ryan had allegedly confessed to her eight months earlier . She said she 'd promised Ryan she would not reveal his secret and says she was unnerved when he gave her a veiled threat . @(Crew-in-court; @!Ms-CREW: @(In-court) I promised him I would never tell anybody . He said , ' I hope not because I would n't want you to be where Sarah is at . ' @!MURPHY: @(Voiceover) But she also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one , would have convicted Ryan . And when they did n't , she contacted the authorities after seeing pictures of Sarah 's mother . @(Jury-room; @!Ms-CREW: @(In-court) I saw the sadness and the pain and the hurt in her mom 's face , and I 'm a mom and I could n't do that to them anymore . They needed to know the truth . @!MURPHY: @(Voiceover) It was a lot to absorb : Ryan confessing , fighting with a wife who was leaving him , blacking out in the bathroom . Would the jurors believe any or all of it ? The defense had to make certain they did n't . But they were worried that they might . @(Photo-of-courtroom @!Ms-GUTIERREZ: I think she had invented this story and started to live it and really wanted to believe it . @!Mr-CLARK: @(In-court) You were convicted of ... @!MURPHY: @(Voiceover) So they aimed for the jugular . Could this woman be trusted ? @(Court-in-session) @!Ms-GUTIERREZ: @(Voiceover) She had a jaded past , theft convictions , stealing . @(Crew-in-court) @!Ms-GUTIERREZ: That 's not something that an honest , credible person does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who managed the dancers , Jennifer Crew admitted to misdemeanor brushes with the law . @(Inside-strip-club; @!Mr-CLARK: @(In-court) You were convicted of theft . @!Ms-CREW: @(In-court) Yes , sir . @!Mr-CLARK: @(In-court) You were also convicted of fraudulent practices , correct ? @!Ms-CREW: @(In-court) I believe that 's what my record states . @!MURPHY: @(Voiceover) She was also in a methadone treatment program for her addiction to painkillers. @(Pills-and-bottles- @!Mr-CLARK: @(In-court) You were using OxyContin for approximately five years . @!Ms-CREW: @(In-court) About five years , yes . @!Mr-CLARK: @(In-court) You 've used false names to get drugs . @!Ms-CREW: @(In-court) Yes , I did . @!MURPHY: @(Voiceover) And the defense indicated , because of her addiction to drugs , her memory was not to be trusted . @(Crew-in-court; @!Mr-CLARK: @(In-court) When the detectives talked to you , you told them that your memory is not very good , did n't you ? @!Ms-CREW: @(In-court) I do n't recall saying that . @!Mr-CLARK: @(In-court) Do you remember telling them , ' I do n't remember exactly verbatim the conversation between you and Ryan . ' @!Ms-CREW: @(In-court) I do not remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on her confusion about what hour the phone call came through , even on what day it was placed . @(Court-in-session; @!Mr-CLARK: @(In-court) When investigators met with you , you told them the call was in the middle of the night . @!Ms-CREW: @(In-court) I was asleep , and I thought that the call came in later than it did . @!Mr-CLARK: Everything critical in terms of time and duration and any memory about the call was all different once she got to testify but only after she saw her phone records . @!MURPHY: @(Voiceover) After Jennifer Crew stepped down , the prosecution called the woman 's fiance to try to undo any damage to her testimony caused by the defense . He confirmed that she related the alleged confessional phone call to him immediately after hanging up that night . @(Crew-in-court; -cou Unidentified Man 10 : @(In-court) She came downstairs crying , and she 's like , ' He did it . She was scared , actually . She was upset . @!MURPHY: @(Voiceover) If the jury believed Jennifer Crew 's story , Ryan Widmer was sunk . So the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story about an emotional call that night from Ryan . And it was another woman who became interested in Ryan Widmer 's case after seeing our first DATELINE report . Melissa Waller from Seattle , like Jennifer Crew from Iowa , struck up a phone and email relationship with Ryan in the fall of 2009 . She says she was drawn to his case after the death of her sister-in-law . @(Ryan-in-court; @!Mr-CLARK: @(In-court) How often do you think you guys talked ? @!Ms-MELISSA-WALLER: @(In-court) It was a few times a week , you know , sometimes more , sometimes less . It was on a frequent basis . We talked about Sarah a lot . @(Voiceover) He was having a really , really hard time accepting everything . @(Photo-of-Sarah-and @!MURPHY: @(Voiceover) She flew to Ohio to visit a friend and to go with another supporter to a bowling fundraiser organized for Widmer 's defense . She even made this video tribute to Ryan and Sarah that she posted on YouTube . Melissa 's husband supported her friendship with Ryan . @(Photo-of-Waller; -W Unidentified Man 11 : Was it a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with her and our relationship that without a shadow of a doubt I was 100 percent behind her . @!Ms-WALLER: I did feel strongly about supporting him . There 's just no chance that he had anything to do with it . @!MURPHY: @(Voiceover) But the importance of the Seattle woman 's story for the defense was that she , too , had had a lengthy phone call with Ryan that finished just six minutes before he called Jennifer Crew in Iowa , the call in which he allegedly confessed to killing his wife . Melissa Waller said Ryan was perfectly composed when she spoke to him for almost two hours that night . @(Waller-in-court; @!Mr-CLARK: @(In-court) How do you know that he was not drunk , he was not upset ? @!Ms-WALLER: @(In-court) Every phone conversation I 've had he 's never been intoxicated or emotionally distraught . I knew that all the times I had talked to him that he was never drunk or upset . @!MURPHY: @(Voiceover) Melissa Waller was convinced that Jennifer Crew had made up the whole story about the confession . @(Waller-in-court; @!Ms-WALLER: I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on stand and lie . @(Crew-in-court) @!MURPHY: @(Voiceover) But , still , had the defense paid a price by putting yet another woman on the stand ? @(Waller) @!MURPHY: Is there a larger issue here ? Is there a risk for you about these women getting involved with Ryan Widmer ? @!Mr-CLARK: That 's easy to get sucked into that , but I think you have to understand what Ryan has going through . He 's never been able to really grieve for Sarah . He 's never been able to mourn properly for her because you ca n't do that when you 're under the gun , charged with the murder . They contacted him and it was companionship . @!MURPHY: @(Voiceover) It was time to wrap up trial number three . The prosecutors saying it was a sudden violent murder . @(Court-in-session) @!Mr-ARNOLD: Anybody who 's been in a relationship knows that sometimes things go off , they snap for no good reason . I think something like that happened . At some point , Ryan saw that his perfect marriage was falling apart and that 's what led @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ undetermined death by natural causes . @(Court-in-session) @!Ms-GUTIERREZ: It 's probably going to bother me for the rest of my life what happened to Sarah . We 'll never know , though . @!MURPHY: @(Voiceover) Sarah had drowned , but how ? A third jury retired for deliberations. @(Photo-of-Sarah; @!HOLT: Coming up , another stunner . A new Sarah enters Ryan 's life . @(Sarah-Manherz-at-c @!MURPHY: Do you love Ryan Widmer ? @!Ms-SARAH-MANHERZ: I love him , yeah . @!HOLT: @(Voiceover) Just who is she ? Later , Ryan tells all . @(Manherz-on-swing; @!MURPHY: You guys kept it secret , did n't you ? @!Mr-WIDMER: Oh , yeah . @(Voiceover) Because I knew they would try to make it into something negative . @(Photo-of-Ryan-and- @!HOLT: @(Voiceover) When The Bathtub Mystery continues . @(Title-graphic) @(Announcements) @!MURPHY: @(Voiceover) The jury had been out for a day . Again , it seemed everyone in Cincinnati was waiting for a verdict . While Widmer still had a number of ardent supporters , trial watchers say this time things were changing in the court of public opinion . @(Outside-courthouse @!Mr-CUNNINGHAM: You have a candlelight vigil for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phone booth . @!MURPHY: @(Voiceover) One strong voice that had turned against Ryan Widmer was talk radio show host Bill Cunningham . He was disgusted , for one thing , with how he said Widmer had exploited the FreeRyanWidmer website. @(Cunningham-in-stud @!Mr-CUNNINGHAM: He used that website , the Internet , to pick up chicks . And that instead of using that to find his innocence , he was bringing in these hot babes from Washington and Iowa . @!MURPHY: For you , it sounds like it fell apart on a character issue . @!Mr-CUNNINGHAM: It did . To me , by the third trial , the evidence did n't change , the facts did n't change , but the wallpaper of the case changed . @!MURPHY: @(Voiceover) Day two and the jury in the courthouse was going round and round . @(Outside-courthouse Unidentified Juror 3 : My stomach was cramping . My shoulders was hurting . I just felt awful . Unidentified Juror 4 : I was nauseous . I did n't -- I have n't felt that way in -- for 20 years . @!MURPHY: @(Voiceover) The jurors were working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call . @(Jury-room) @!Mr-WIDMER: @(911-audiotape) My wife fell asleep in the bathtub and I think she 's dead . Unidentified Juror 5 : The more you listen to it , the more and more it starts to sound like it was staged . @!MURPHY: @(Voiceover) And there was Sarah 's body . Officers had testified it was too dry . @(Crime-scene-photo) Unidentified Juror 6 : Two and a half minutes later after being removed from a tub , you would expect a body to be wet . @!MURPHY: @(Voiceover) The alleged confession as recounted by Jennifer Crew . @(Crew-in-court) Juror 4 : I just do n't believe anything she said . @!MURPHY: @(Voiceover) The prints in the tub . @(Crime-scene-photo) Juror 6 : And in normal circumstances you can not leave those kind of fingerprints on the side of the tub trailing down . @!MURPHY: @(Voiceover) The bruising to Sarah . @(Drawing-and-docume Juror 5 : I think both the defense and the prosecution put up good arguments about that . That 's on a -- teetering on a razor 's edge with me. @!MURPHY: @(Voiceover) At the end of the second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They had a verdict . A blast of calls went out . The Kists grabbed a stunned Ryan . @(Jury-room; @!Ms-KIST: We immediately jumped in the car . Ryan says , ' I ca n't believe they 're back this soon . This is too quick . I 'm worried . ' @!MURPHY: @(Voiceover) When everyone was gathered in the courtroom , the judge asked for the jury ballot . @(People-entering-co @!MURPHY: Anxious ? @!Ms-KIST: Very . @!Mr-KIST: Oh , yeah . Sick . @!Ms-KIST: Sick . @!Mr-KIST: Yeah . @!MURPHY: @(Voiceover) Ryan Widmer stood with his lawyers , his life hanging in the balance . @(Ryan-in-court) @!Ms-GUTIERREZ: @(Voiceover) I can actually hear Ryan shaking . @(Clark-Gutierrez-a @!Ms-GUTIERREZ: I can hear it and it 's that silent in there and he 's that nervous . @!MURPHY: @(Voiceover) The verdict . @(Court-in-session) Judge 2 : @(In-court) " We , the jury in this case , find the defendant Ryan K. Widmer is guilty of murder . " @!MURPHY: @(Voiceover) Guilty . Ryan dropped his head to the table . @(Ryan-dropping-head @!Ms-KIST: He was hysterical . He was crying . @(Voiceover) He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , bad dream . @(Ryan-in-court) @!MURPHY: @(Voiceover) Ryan composed himself enough to proclaim to the court his innocence . @(Court-in-session) @!Mr-WIDMER: @(In-court) Judge , I did not do this . I do n't know why this has to keep going on . I mean , my life has been ruined . I love Sarah . I would never have hurt her . Never . @!MURPHY: @(Voiceover) Outside the court , Ryan 's father , Gary , slumped to the ground . The son he was recently reunited with after years apart taken from him again . @(Gary-and-woman-wal @!GARY: It was horrifying . It was a horrifying moment . @(Voiceover) And I think it just totally caught up with me at that point , the whole total shock , and I just went weak . @(Gary-and-woman-on- @!MURPHY: @(Voiceover) Ryan Widmer , for the second time , was given the mandatory sentence , 15 years to life . As court officers handcuffed him and led him away , few people were aware of a young woman on his side of the benches crying . This is also a Sarah , Sarah Manherz , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has had so many . @(Ryan-surrounded-by @!MURPHY: Do you love Ryan Widmer ? @!Ms-MANHERZ: I love him . Yeah . @!MURPHY: @(Voiceover) She wears an engagement ring and is the mother of Ryan 's son , born in the summer after trial number two . @(Ring-on-Manherz-ha @!MURPHY: What 'd you name the baby ? @!Ms-MANHERZ: His name is Ryan . @!MURPHY: Do you see Ryan 's face in the baby 's ? @!Ms-MANHERZ: Yeah . @!MURPHY: @(Voiceover) Sarah , a Canadian via New York , like Jennifer from Iowa and Melissa from Seattle , also became aware of Ryan after our first DATELINE program on the case aired back in 2009. @(Manherz-on-swing; @!Ms-MANHERZ: I thought that he was railroaded . I really did . @!MURPHY: @(Voiceover) She sent an email to Ryan saying how sorry she felt for him , and he sent one back . Soon they were talking on the phone . A little more than a month later , Sarah came to Cincinnati to visit Ryan . She stayed with him at his mother 's house . @(Manherz-at-compute @!Ms-MANHERZ: I thought it was a little awkward , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the phone , but we had n't met . And , you know , he just was telling me how much he loved Sarah ... @(Manherz-on-swing) @!Ms-MANHERZ: ... and he could never , ever love another woman as much as he loved her . I think I started crying because I just felt so bad for him . @!MURPHY: @(Voiceover) Sarah went back to New York and then three weeks later returned to Cincinnati as Ryan 's guest at his mother 's Thanksgiving dinner . That was the weekend they became intimate . @(New-York-street; @!Ms-MANHERZ: @(Voiceover) Like the first time we were together I got pregnant . @(Photo-of-Manherz-a @!MURPHY: @(Voiceover) How did Ryan take the news ? @(Manherz) @!Ms-MANHERZ: @(Voiceover) He was shocked . @(Manherz) @!Ms-MANHERZ: Obviously very bad timing . @!MURPHY: @(Voiceover) They kept the pregnancy a secret , as Ryan 's second trial would take place the following May . @(Photo-of-Ryan-and- @!Ms-MANHERZ: I decided that I was going to have the baby and he was OK with that , but it was just difficult because I 'm thinking , ' Here I am pregnant , and you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up without a father . Which now with -- now he 's in jail . @!MURPHY: @(Voiceover) With Ryan sentenced to 15 years , Sarah is raising their son alone . @(Manherz-by-fence) @!Ms-MANHERZ: I 'm still in shock . I ca n't believe this happened to him . I feel like a piece of me is gone . I love him , and I 'm not going to leave his side . I 'm going to do whatever I can . @!MURPHY: If in your own mind you could n't get to beyond a reasonable doubt , there was a sliver of doubt that maybe he had done this thing , would you have stayed ? @!Ms-MANHERZ: Never . I would have never stay with him , I would n't be with him now . There 's no way that he could have done this , ever . @!MURPHY: @(Voiceover) But had he ? It 's been more than three years since Sarah 's death . In the course of three trials played out before three juries , Ryan Widmer 's guilt or innocence has been passionately debated . He is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Widmer speaks from prison when we return . @(Crime-scene; @!MURPHY: Did you kill your wife , Sarah ? @!HOLT: @(Voiceover) Coming up , a DATELINE exclusive . @(Water-dripping-and @!MURPHY: You think they fabricated this . @!Mr-WIDMER: Oh , I know they did . @!HOLT: @(Voiceover) This young husband is about to make a startling claim . @(Ryan-exiting-doorw @(Announcements) @!MURPHY: @(Voiceover) This is Ryan Widmer 's story as he tells it . He remembers a loving relationship with his wife , Sarah , that was right from the first date . @(Title-graphic; @!Mr-WIDMER: We hit it off perfect . @!MURPHY: Was there any friction ? @!Mr-WIDMER: None whatsoever . @!MURPHY: Everything was -- everything was cool ? @!Mr-WIDMER: Perfect . Perfect . @!MURPHY: @(Voiceover) He only had one worry about Sarah . @(Photo-of-Ryan-and- @!Mr-WIDMER: My biggest problem with her was her sleep . She would just work a regular day and she needed to go to bed early , or she 'd be taking a nap . And I just thought something was n't healthy about it . You 're 24 years old . @!MURPHY: @(Voiceover) But still , he says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , walking the dog , building a deck on their house . All routine , he says , until that August night . Sarah had come home from work , he says , with a headache . They had dinner , watched TV. @(Photos-of-Ryan-and @!MURPHY: She 's what , on the couch ? @!Mr-WIDMER: Laying on the couch , yeah . @!MURPHY: Because she does n't feel so hot ? @!Mr-WIDMER: She said her neck was killing her , she 's going to go get in the bath and she 's going to go to bed . @!MURPHY: @(Voiceover) Ryan says he stayed downstairs watching the game until he , too , was ready for bed . Upstairs to the master bedroom and bath . @(Football-game-on-t @!MURPHY: Tell me what you see just like a videotape recording . @!Mr-WIDMER: I walk in the room . I walk over to the nightstand and I put some things down and turn on the TV , and then I walked into the bathroom . That 's when I saw Sarah . I knew something was n't right . @(Voiceover) She was just unconscious . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @!Mr-WIDMER: @(Voiceover) Her head was just underneath the water . @(Water) @!Mr-WIDMER: I mean , I do n't even remember ... @!MURPHY: Was she facedown in the tub as you tell 911 ? @!Mr-WIDMER: All I remember is , yeah , just finding her -- I mean , I knew it was n't good . I mean , she was laying in the water . I do n't know what else to say other than it was n't right . The only thing , I remember certain things because of what I heard on the 911 tape . @!MURPHY: But it 's such a shocking image , you 'd think you 'd remember . @!Mr-WIDMER: I was n't thinking , ' I 'm going to have to remember . What did I see ? What did I do ? ' @!MURPHY: Head , what ? Nose , mouth down below the water ? @!Mr-WIDMER: Everything , yeah . @!MURPHY: What did you do next ? @!Mr-WIDMER: I 'm trying to get any sort of reaction out of her , and I got nothing . @!MURPHY: @(Voiceover) That 's when he says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the bathtub and I think she 's dead . @!MURPHY: When you chose that word , ' I think she fell asleep . ' @!Mr-WIDMER: It 's not about choosing a word , it 's about what I said . I mean , I just -- it was just the whole -- her sleeping issue or whatever , I do n't know . @!MURPHY: They would say that , ' That 911 call is suspicious because this guy 's giving us too much information . He 's telling us he 's downstairs . ' @!Mr-WIDMER: Mm-hmm . @!MURPHY: ' He 's away from all the stuff that 's going on . She 's upstairs . Do you know why you told them you were downstairs watching the game ? @!Mr-WIDMER: What else am I supposed -- because I was watching the football game .

I mean , I called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know . @!MURPHY: @(Voiceover) Prosecutors say the first arriving officer was at the house no more than six minutes after the 911 call was answered , and less than three minutes after Ryan lifted Sarah 's body out of the tub . @(Headlights-on-gara @!MURPHY: The observations of the arriving officer , ' What do we have here ? Why is this woman 's hair damp and is her body dry ? ' @!Mr-WIDMER: Yeah , well ... @!MURPHY: It does n't make sense , Ryan . @!Mr-WIDMER: I understand that . @!MURPHY: So how do you explain it ? @!Mr-WIDMER: How do I explain it ? I left the house and there was cops there by themselves , and they came up with the story they wanted to come up with . @!MURPHY: Oh , you think they fabricated this ? @!Mr-WIDMER: Oh , I know they did . @!MURPHY: So you think they wanted to make a case here ? @!Mr-WIDMER: Mm-hmm , I know they did . Why would they arrest me a day after if they did n't want to make a case ? @!MURPHY: Why would they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? EMTs and police officers do n't even work for the same agency . @!Mr-WIDMER: They clearly do when they get up there to testify , because they 're clearly coached into what to say . @!MURPHY: @(Voiceover) And what about the story of the woman who says Ryan confessed to her that he 'd killed Sarah ? @(Witness-in-court) @!Ms-CREW: @(In-court) ' Listen to me , I did it . ' @!MURPHY: Here 's Jennifer Crew from Iowa on the stand saying , ' He called me one night . ' @!Mr-WIDMER: Mm-hmm . @!MURPHY: ' He was sloppy , and he confessed to me. ' @!Mr-WIDMER: Right . @!MURPHY: ' Jennifer , I did it . I 'm telling you , I did it . ' @!Mr-WIDMER: Mm-hmm . @!MURPHY: Did that conversation happen ? @!Mr-WIDMER: Nope , it never happened . @!MURPHY: So Jennifer Crew 's story is made up ? @!Mr-WIDMER: One hundred percent made up . @!MURPHY: @(Voiceover) The same goes , Ryan told us , for Sarah 's mother 's testimony about hearing hateful arguments between the couple . Sarah Widmer 's Mother : @(In-court) They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a liar . @!MURPHY: Sarah 's mom is a liar ? @!Mr-WIDMER: Yeah . @!MURPHY: She 's making the stuff up ? @!Mr-WIDMER: We were never mean to each other , never . @!MURPHY: @(Voiceover) A one- time mother-in-law from an earlier life who he says is embellishing the reality of his marriage . Now , Ryan Widmer has a baby with a new Sarah . @(Woman-on-witness-s @!Mr-WIDMER: She 's awesome . So loving , caring . There 's similarities I see in Sarah , my wife , as I see with Sarah now . @!MURPHY: You guys kept it secret , did n't you ? @!Mr-WIDMER: Oh , yeah , because I knew they would -- they would make it -- try to make it into something negative . @!MURPHY: @(Voiceover) And in that court of public opinion , the women from far away places -- Iowa , Seattle , New York -- who became involved in his case did n't go down well with everyone , a character issue . @(Court-house; @!MURPHY: We talked to somebody who 's accused you of using the FreeRyanWidmer website as like a dating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That it was just your way of meeting women . @!Mr-WIDMER: That 's not true . I do n't know who would have said that , but that 's not true . @!MURPHY: @(Voiceover) But investigators wondered how good the marriage really was based on what they say they found on Widmer 's computer . @(Photo-of-Ryan-and- @!MURPHY: Did you have an unhealthy addiction to porn ? @!Mr-WIDMER: No. @!MURPHY: You looked at porn ? @!Mr-WIDMER: Yeah . @!MURPHY: @(Voiceover) But Ryan says that does n't mean anything , and certainly does n't make him a murderer . @(Photo-of-Ryan-and- @!MURPHY: Did you kill your wife , Sarah ? @!Mr-WIDMER: No , I did not .

Nope . @!MURPHY: Did n't happen . @!Mr-WIDMER: Did not happen . @!MURPHY: You were watching the ball game , went upstairs and you found her in a bad situation ? @!Mr-WIDMER: Yeah . @!MURPHY: And that 's it ? @!Mr-WIDMER: That 's it . @!MURPHY: And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . @!MURPHY: But you did n't put her head underwater ? @!Mr-WIDMER: No , absolutely not . @!MURPHY: So you 're saying you 're wrongly convicted ? @!Mr-WIDMER: Oh , I 'm 100 percent wrongfully convicted . @!MURPHY: And if 30 jurors or more ... @!Mr-WIDMER: Mm-hmm . @!MURPHY: ... found you guilty after they heard the story ... @!Mr-WIDMER: Yep . @!MURPHY: ... they 're not getting it . @!Mr-WIDMER: They 're not getting it at all . @!MURPHY: @(Voiceover) But these jurors from his third trial are confident they got it right . They say , among other things , it came down to what they saw as Sarah 's too dry body , oddities in the 911 call , prints on the tub , and the unlikeliness of an out-of-the-blue medical event striking Sarah in the bath . @(Jury-members; -bath Juror 5 : I went into it believing that he was innocent , but everything that was put together with the evidence came down with four or five facts that we could not deny .

##4103540 @!MR-CHUCK-TODD: They are . We 're going to start with electability and two weeks ago if we told you electability would be the most important issue in South Carolina you would assume a Romney runaway . Well , guess what ? In this case it was Newt Gingrich who won the electability argument . Half the people that said electability was the most important picked Gingrich , 51-37 . Here 's probably the more important reason why he won South Carolina . He became the conservative alternative . Look at this , 48 percent of those that describe themselves very conservative picked Gingrich ; less than 20 percent , less than one in five voters saw Mitt Romney as the conservative . If he can carry that forward into other states that 's how Gingrich becomes the alternative . Now , let 's look ahead to Florida . Florida 's not quite as conservative as South Carolina , but it 's a lot more conservative than New Hampshire . Four years ago , 61 percent of Republican primary voters called themselves conservative . This could be a recipe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he thought he was going to have . @!MR-GREGORY: Why we 're watching it so closely . So , Chuck , you 'll join us here . Let me turn to Joe Scarborough . Why did Newt Gingrich win ? @!MR-JOE-SCARBOROUGH: David , David . I love how you got the Newt treatment already this morning , right ? @!MR-GREGORY: Right , right . @!MR-SCARBOROUGH: You 're a part of the enemy . @!MR-GREGORY: Right . @!MR-SCARBOROUGH: What ... @!MR-GREGORY: But when he talked about the media elite ... @!MR-SCARBOROUGH: Right . @!MR-GREGORY: ... in New York he 's talking about you . That 's who he 's talking about . @!MR-SCARBOROUGH: It 's all me . I will tell you one reason he did not win last night . It was n't because he 's a conservative , because Newt 's not a conservative . He uses this resentment , these -- the politics of grievance to actually hide a record that you can really identify very quickly on Google . You know , the remarkable thing , and this is why Republicans are panicked in Washington , D.C. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mitt Romney supported an individual mandate . Newt Gingrich supported an individual mandate . Newt Gingrich supported cap and trade at one point , so did Mitt Romney . You can go down the list . You know , of course , you 've got Ronald Reagan being brushed aside by Mitt Romney . But on this program just a year ago you had Newt Gingrich calling Paul Ryan a right-wing radical who was engaged in social engineering . It is a mess out there . And I think you 're going to hear more people like Bill Kristol , Erick Erickson talking about a brokered convention . If Newt Gingrich wins Florida everything 's up for grabs . @!MR-GREGORY: Mike Murphy , look what we have here . @!MR-MIKE-MURPHY: Yeah . @!MR-GREGORY: We have three big contests. @!MR-MURPHY: Mm-hmm . @!MR-GREGORY: We have three different winners . As I said at the top , this thing could go on a while . @!MR-MURPHY: Yeah , and you know from a delegate point of view we 're only in the first inning here . If it becomes a delegate contest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Romney 's in some real vulnerability now , but he 's got a lot of assets , too . Chuck 's right , Florida is not quite as movement conservative as South Carolina . I think the Romney guys made a forgivable error betting heavy on a state that was very bad terrain for Mitt . But there is a bigger problem . Last five days he lost his message . He got on defense , and for a guy like Romney who 's done well getting conservatives who are lukewarm about him to vote for him because he looks like he can beat Obama , to be up there in a defensive crouch apparently unable to release taxes and defend his wealth , sends a subtext message of maybe in the class warfare we know is coming he ca n't beat Obama . That 's kryptonite for Romney if he loses that winability thing , and you saw in those numbers . So Monday night at this big debate tomorrow on NBC Romney 's got to take this race back , he 's got to tweak his message , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -- there are no firewalls in primaries when it 's -- when you lose control of the agenda . @!MR-GREGORY: The tax release , does this help now ? Does it ... @!MR-MURPHY: Yeah . @!MR-GREGORY: ... put it to rest ? @!MR-MURPHY: It should have been earlier . I 'd say wear a suit made out of your tax returns Monday night and defend and win that argument because that 's what people need to see to think Mitt Romney can beat Obama . But Tuesday will be fine . They got to reclock the campaign , they got to go into Florida hard , they got to hurt Newt . But they ca n't fall under the complacency of a big campaign that " Hey , we got five more waves of mail than he does . " It a message thing . And that 's earned me the ... @(unintelligible) . @!MR-GREGORY: Well , let 's talk about message , Katty Kay , because Joe 's been talking about this all week long , which is the politics of grievance . I keep asking when does the tea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think we now know . Listen to Newt Gingrich last night proclaiming victory . @(Videotape-last-ni @!FMR-REP-GINGRICH: I believe the debate we 're going to have with President Obama over the next eight or nine months , the outlining of the two Americas , the America of the Declaration of Independence , the America of Saul Alinsky , the America of paychecks , the America of food stamps , the America of independence , the America of dependence , the America of strength in foreign policy , the America of weakness in foreign policy . @(End-videotape) @!MR-GREGORY: I mean , this is a grittier , angrier , more populist message than we 're hearing from Mitt Romney. @!MS-KATTY-KAY: Which is why he won in South Carolina . I mean , for the man who styles himself as an intellectual , perhaps the only candidate out there on the Republican platform that self-styles himself as a grandiose thinker , this was actually a campaign all about heart . This is not about Newt Gingrich 's policies that people elected him for last night in South Carolina , it 's because they feel he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Barack Obama . The conservative movement is feeling rebellious and Newt Gingrich has styled himself as a rebel . And that 's exactly what people responded to . Now in the past what you 've seen with Gingrich is that he 's had these peaks . We saw it way back in ' 94 , and we saw it in December again during the course of this campaign and then he crashes . So the question 's going to be can he and his personality , let alone the mechanics , the endorsements , the money , the ground war of this campaign , can he keep it all in check ? And I think that 's still a very reasonable question to ask about a candidate . @!MR-TODD: And , you know , actually , and to pick up on that point , Newt Gingrich has a , has a gulf of nothing in February . There are n't a lot of primaries , there are not going to be a lot of debates , you have a few caucuses early , two primaries at the end . One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're going to sort of write that off . So there 'll only be really a battle in Arizona . And the last time there was sort of nothing , remember in between a debate in Iowa , that is when Gingrich sort of got a little too full of himself and did shoot himself in the foot . But this is -- is this about Newt Gingrich or is this about Mitt Romney ? This is still about Mitt Romney . He has n't ... @(unintelligible) . @!MR-SCARBOROUGH: It 's about Mitt. @!MR-GREGORY: Yeah . @!MR-TODD: He has n't made the sale to conservatives , and losing in South Carolina he ca n't dismiss it . This is the heart and soul of the movement conservatives , the -- of the folks that show up at telephones , that knock on the doors and he does n't have their support . @!MR-SCARBOROUGH: David ... @!MR-GREGORY: Joe , can I just say one thing ? @!MR-SCARBOROUGH: Yeah . @!MR-GREGORY: Glenn Thrush on Politico covers the White House . He put something on Twitter last night that I thought kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Boehner-Cantor dynamic on last year 's budget . GOP establishment blesses , party base revolts every time . " @!MR-SCARBOROUGH: Yeah , I mean there 's no doubt about it , the party base is revolting , but they 're revolting against the Washington Republican establishment anointing Mitt Romney , just like Herman Cain was not about Herman Cain . It was a rejection of Mitt Romney . Rick Perry , a rejection of Mitt Romney . Michele Bachmann , a rejection of Mitt Romney . Newt Gingrich , wave one , a rejection of Mitt Romney . Now we have Newt Gingrich wave two , a rejection of Mitt Romney . Now , Mitt Romney could attack Newt for not being a conservative because Newt is not a conservative . Google it ! It -- we ran him out of Congress in 1998 because he sold us out on taxes , he sold us out on spending . He went to the floor and he sided with Democrats on his last speech calling us the perfectionist caucus . He 'd call us jihadists . He 's not a conservative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problem , so is Mitt Romney . And the Republican establishment in Washington gave us $5 trillion of debt during the Bush era . They took $155 billion surplus , they turned it into a $1 trillion deficit . They engaged in radical foreign policy Wilsonian foreign policy . George Bush promising to end tyranny across the globe . The conservative movement is saying " No , stop . Gingrich is not going to be our final choice but we are not handing this off to Mitt Romney right now . " @!MR-MURPHY: The -- it 's a real dilemma for Romney because what Newt is doing is the simplest strategy in the world , and I agree with Joe . Romney can kind of hurt him on this . But what Newt is great at is kind of playing the piano with the music of resentment in the Republican primary electorate . We got a lot of mad people . But the reason that liquor sales in the last 24 hours have quadrupled in Washington is truckloads of champagne are going over to the Pelosi office and hard whiskey 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carry in a general election a swing state if it was made of feathers . This is a fact of politics . And primary voters , it 's easy to emotionally get tied up in a campaign like this , but in a general election , it 's a problem . So Mitt 's got to somehow fend off Newt and stay viable . @!MR-GREGORY: And , and you 've actually said triangulate , go more to the middle . @!MR-MURPHY: Yeah . @!MR-GREGORY: Even for the rest of the primaries . Why and how ? @!MR-MURPHY: Well , after he 's got it locked . @!MR-GREGORY: Yeah . @!MR-MURPHY: I thought he might lose South Carolina by two points , not 12 . Mitt 's got a problem , he 's got to grab it back . It 's probably going to take all of February . But if , if , if Mitt does that , fixes his message and gets back in charge , and he has a lot of assets to do it , if he can fix the message problem , he 's got the mechanics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He 'll follow him around , he 'll win some Guam caucus . That 's an opportunity for Mitt to do what you got to do to win the general election . Because the Newt message is Democrats win the House , we lose the Senate in a general election . It would be a train wreck . Romney ca n't be contaminated by that , either . @!MR-GREGORY: Mm-hmm . @!MR-MURPHY: It 's a very tough course for him . @!MR-GREGORY: Katty. @!MS-KAY: And he knows that the White House is loving all of this , of course . I mean , they 're watching what happened in South Carolina and they see no way that this does n't help them at all . The ads against Newt Gingrich write themselves , whether it 's taxes and speech money or firing people , I mean , the language is all there , he said it . But Romney also clearly has a problem , this is something that you were suggesting earlier , David , that there 's something about the kind of mood of the country at the moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of put out there about inequality and financial insecurity and a middle class that is feeling insecure , that we are concentrating ... @!MR-SCARBOROUGH: You 're sounding like Newt Gingrich now . @!MS-KAY: Well , we ca n't say ... @!MR-SCARBOROUGH: Which is the most remarkable thing . Newt Gingrich adopts the language of Michael Moore ? @!MR-GREGORY: Right . @!MS-KAY: Right , right . @!MR-SCARBOROUGH: And a week later he 's the conservative alternative ? No . It does n't work that way . @!MS-KAY: Right . But , David -- Joe , look , you 're not -- I mean , people are not concentrating on Romney 's flip-flops as much as they are on his money . And Mitt Romney simply has n't found a way to be easy in this economic climate with his finances . @!MR-SCARBOROUGH: They 're not focusing on Mitt Romney . No . They 're not focusing on Mitt Romney 's money , they 're focusing on Mitt Romney 's tongue . @!MS-KAY: Yeah . Because he ca n't -- right . @!MR-SCARBOROUGH: He ca n't answer a question that he knows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked the governor , Governor Christie , what is his big contribution to the conservative cause ? And it is , well , that he 's been a good businessman . @!MR-TODD: Yeah . He went to Bain . @!MR-GREGORY: This is not how to connect to conservatives . @!MR-TODD: No . It is not , although ... @!MR-GREGORY: Alone , alone I should say . @!MR-TODD: ... I 'll give -- you have to give Governor Christie credit . How , how is it that Mitt Romney has n't come up with the line , " Hey , those jobs at Staples , these are middle class jobs . " And you 're sitting there going , wow , so Chris Christie can actually make a better case for what Bain 's done than Mitt Romney ? @!MR-GREGORY: Right . Well , maybe this is the case for him being on the ticket . @!MR-TODD: I mean , it was , it was stunning at that . But you know , we 've talked about this connection problem Romney might have with swing voters in middle class America because of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got a connection problem with the base of the party . The problem that Mitt Romney 's going to have over the next three weeks is this sort of hammering , while Newt , it 's easy to sort of pile on Newt and attack Newt . That 's going to be the easy party . The hand-wringing of oh , should there be other candidates that jump in ? @!MR-GREGORY: Yeah . @!MR-TODD: Do n't forget that they 'll be third party . You know , every time Newt 's risen , those folks at Americans Elect suddenly get more phone call . @!MR-GREGORY: Well , and let me take a break here , but come back to that point that -- since it 's a big football day , the fantasy football part of the GOP race , which is is there anyone else out there ? We 'll take a break . Back with that in just a moment . @(Announcements) @!MR-GREGORY: We 're back with our roundtable . Mike Murphy , we now have this South Carolina scramble . @!MR-MURPHY: Right . @!MR-GREGORY: And that view in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anybody else out there ? Jeb Bush is saying he 's not going to endorse . @!MR-MURPHY: Right . @!MR-GREGORY: He was a heavy recruit . And then there 's Mitch Daniels who , oh by the way , governor of Indiana who declined to run , is going to give the response to the president 's State of the Union address . Is there going to be more fantasy football here in the GOP race ? @!MR-MURPHY: It 's inevitable . You know , there 's a fantasy football industry , our friend Bill Kristol , I think his garage is full of Mitch Daniels yard signs that probably Mitch has n't even seen . Yeah , it could happen . Flying saucer could land tomorrow , too , and aliens declare the primary over . I think it 's highly unlikely . If Mitt Romney can get his message back and explain that making money for Bain is making money for working people and jobs , college endowments , pension funds so people can retire and go on offense and get the damn taxes out and defend them and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a long slog but it 'll be an orderly slog . If not , if , if this wildfire spreads and Newt Gingrich wins the Florida primary , then that speculation will explode . The plumbing and wiring of it is very hard , and a lot of it assumes that these miracle candidates will look very pretty in the showroom ... @!MR-GREGORY: Sure . @!MR-MURPHY: ... when they get in , will be equally pretty , which is always a very risky assumption . @!MR-GREGORY: But Joe , it 's also about -- yeah . There 's still a lot of dissatisfaction with the field . @!MR-SCARBOROUGH: Mm-hmm . @!MR-GREGORY: But you know , everybody talks about near-death experiences . Mitt Romney will likely , if he becomes the nominee , will be a stronger nominee having gone through this rather than going 3-and-0. @!MR-SCARBOROUGH: He will be . He will be . But if Newt Gingrich wins Florida and then everybody has a month to think about it ... @!MR-GREGORY: Hm. @!MR-SCARBOROUGH: ... that 's when somebody like Haley Barbour , who says a Newt Gingrich nomination would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he knows . Newt 's approval rating this past week , 27 percent nationwide , disapproval 59 percent . In 1995 , do you know what it was ? Twenty-seven percent approval rating , 60 percent disapproval . He knows . Newt Gingrich ... @!MR-TODD: @(Unintelligible) @!MR-SCARBOROUGH: One point . He knows that that 's a nightmare . Now there 's another scenario that people like Bill Kristol and others will be looking at moving forward , and that is , and I 've heard a lot of talk about this , favorite sons . A California favorite son , a New Jersey , New York , Connecticut , Texas . You 've got a lot of big states that are still open . Indiana , Arkansas . There is a real possibility that you could have different candidates , if Haley Barbour and others get together , that run . @!MR-GREGORY: Mm-hmm . @!MR-SCARBOROUGH: Gunk up the process enough that nobody gets a majority and then Jeb Bush is dragged kicking and screaming to the convention . @!MR-GREGORY: @(Unintelligible) @!MS-KAY: But ... @!MR-MURPHY: Well , it could happen , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd all be speaking French . It 's not impossible , but here 's the one -- here 's a little detail , though . @!MR-SCARBOROUGH: You know , Murphy , I -- you 're going to run out of these things . @!MR-MURPHY: I know , I 'm ... @(unintelligible) ... the establishment . But I 'll tell you ... @!MR-GREGORY: No , I do n't think it 's possible . @!MR-TODD: No , I think he ... @!MR-SCARBOROUGH: But I 'll tell you what , I 'll tell you want . Ten , 10 days ago you could 've used your Martians and your Napoleon subs ... @!MR-MURPHY: Right , right , right . @!MR-SCARBOROUGH: ... on Newt Gingrich winning by 12 points in South Carolina . @!MS-KAY: But , OK ... @!MR-MURPHY: One primary does not a primary make . @!MS-KAY: No. @!MR-MURPHY: Let me very quickly say one little footnote in the notes . The way most delegates are chosen , some are elected , some are elected by their own caucuses . They go and they 're instructed to vote by who wins the primary . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them to vote for ... @!MR-GREGORY: Watch out . @!MR-MURPHY: ... a lot better for Newt . A lot of Romney delegates are not guys in Duck Pants who are looking for a moderate , they 're pretty hard-core , even Christian conservatives who are instructed to vote by the results . @!MS-KAY: OK , but let 's get ... @!MR-MURPHY: You let that loose . @!MS-KAY: ... let 's get through Florida first . @!MR-MURPHY: Of course . @!MS-KAY: Because it 's going to be harder for Gingrich in Florida . I mean , he goes into a state where it 's going to be all TV ads , it 's not the retail politics that plays to his heart stuff . @!MR-SCARBOROUGH: @(Unintelligible) @!MR-GREGORY: Yeah . @!MS-KAY: And look what the Romney campaign did to him in Iowa with TV ads . They dump that on him again in ... @!MR-SCARBOROUGH: Actually , this is ... @!MR-TODD: Rick Scott 's governor of that state . @!MR-SCARBOROUGH: Yeah . @!MR-TODD: There are a lot of smart people who said and Rick Scott was the tea party guy , Bill McCollum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They -- you know , and Jeb actually went out on a limb to do everything he could to stop that guy . The establishment did n't do it . But we are in , and Mike keeps bringing -- alluding to it , we 've seen this movie before . It was 1992 and there was talk of in the Democrats of a brokered convention , Bill Clinton , oh , my God , he 's going to blow this , it 's an easy opportunity to beat the incumbent president . But it did lead to the creation of Perot . This is going to lead -- the , the longer this goes on , I think the ideas of a brokered convention are sort of past , the , the Republicans would be afraid of it . But the idea of , of , of third party guys popping up , I think that 's going to be ... @(unintelligible) . @!MR-MURPHY: @(Unintelligible) @!MR-GREGORY: Let me , let me get another quick break in here . @!MR-MURPHY: Sure . Yeah . @!MR-GREGORY: Another quick break in . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of course , on the race for 2012 , our trends and takeways , a look at what was said here today that made news , and what to look for in this very important week coming up . The hot political stories , as well , what are trending this morning . That 's right after this . @(Announcements) @!MR-GREGORY: As we always do , we monitor the conversation on Facebook during the program , and this is what we were just talking about , some feedback . This is from John Coffren , " Christie is the exact type of leader we need . It 's a shame he does n't run . " So that who else is out there thing is , is still going on . @!MR-MURPHY: @(Unintelligible) ... take their time . @!MR-GREGORY: The big story today , Mitt Romney saying he will release taxes on Tuesday after a bad week of stumbles on this answer . This is how Newt Gingrich responded to me on that point . @!FMR-REP-GINGRICH: I think that 's a very good thing he 's doing and I commend him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right thing to do . And as far as I 'm concerned , that particular issue 's now set to side and we can go and talk about other bigger and more important things . @!MR-GREGORY: It was interesting , Joe , last week on this program is when Speaker Gingrich said he ought to release them . @!MR-SCARBOROUGH: Right . @!MR-GREGORY: Do you think he 's leave it at that and say , look , he did the right thing . There 's no , there 's nothing to see here ? @!MR-SCARBOROUGH: No . I 'm surprised he closed the door because Mitt 's talking about releasing it for one year . You know , I 'm -- I suspect by the end he 'll ask for the 12 years that Mitt 's dad did . @!MR-GREGORY: The other big factor here this week , of course , big event tomorrow night , our own debate , Brian Williams moderating in Tampa here on NBC . How does Mitt Romney use this debate when we know this is the life blood for Newt Gingrich ? @!MR-TODD: We already know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defang Gingrich on , on the tax returns . So get that out of the way . Do them for the day after so it 's not part of the debate . Oh , by the way , release it on State of the Union day . You 're not going to be able to cover that up but I think you 're going to see then Mitt try to turn the tables , release your Freddie and Fannie contract , release your ethics report , try to sort of turn the tables a little bit . But you know what ? Romney four years ago when he went on the attack was not good at it . @!MR-GREGORY: Yeah , that 's the question , Mike . I mean ... @!MR-MURPHY: Mm-hmm . @!MR-GREGORY: ... does he -- is he in fighting shape to do this ? @!MR-MURPHY: Well , let 's put it this way , he 's in a corner with a broken bottle and somebody coming at him . He 's going to learn to fight or he 's going to lose . @!MR-GREGORY: We have n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Gingrich to try to get him out of the race ? @!MS-KAY: Well , the longer he stays in and splits the vote with Ron Paul , then the more it helps Romney . I mean , they 've got to be pushing Santorum to get out of the race . @!MR-MURPHY: He -- I think -- go ahead ... @!MS-KAY: But , you know , that 's what , that 's what Gingrich needs . @!MR-GREGORY: Mm-hmm . Mike : @!MR-MURPHY: The Santorum bet is big conservative vote that Newt has , Newt 's nuke , he 'll implode , then it 's mine . So they 're going to hang around . @!MR-SCARBOROUGH: And some evangelical leaders even last night said they have got to focus the fire more on Newt and line up behind Rick Santorum . But , I mean , the bottom line is , I 'm sorry , Newt is not sustainable . Nobody that 's known him since ' 95 thinks he 's sustainable . Last night was not about Newt , It was a primal scream by South Carolina voters against the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if you had to put the vast Gregory fortune somewhere , you 'd have to still put it on Mitt Romney being the nominee . @!MR-TODD: Look , there 's one ... @!MR-GREGORY: Let me establish who the media elite is , and it 's Scarborough . @!MR-TODD: Right . One piece of good news in Florida ... @!MS-KAY: You know , it 's ... @!MR-TODD: ... just a quick break it down , snowbirds. @!MR-GREGORY: Yeah . @!MR-TODD: Snowbirds are there . In January they show up . And by the way , these folks , the reason they moved to Florida was because they 're rich and they do n't want to pay so many taxes . These are Romney Republicans . @!MR-MURPHY: Right . @!MR-TODD: They -- he starts out with small advantages like that . @!MR-MURPHY: And also , a tiny thing but it 's important , there are probably 150 to 190,000 absentee votes already in back when Mitt had a 15 point lead , probably a million and one voters , but having those 30,000 already banked ... @!MR-TODD: Banked . @!MR-GREGORY: Yeah . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 or 2 point or maybe 3 point advantage . I say it 's for Romney. @!MS-KAY: Romney does n't do well in the debates when he 's trying to fight . It just does n't seem to come naturally to him . @!MR-GREGORY: Yeah . @!MS-KAY: But those super PAC ads of his in Iowa against Gingrich were pretty effective . @!MR-GREGORY: And , and ... @!MR-SCARBOROUGH: And look for him also in Florida because just like Gingrich knew he had to beat him in South Carolina , they know they have to destroy Gingrich in Florida . @!MS-KAY: Yeah . @!MR-GREGORY: This conversation , our conversation is going to go on . I just wish it were still on television , but we 're out of time . ' 
##4103541 @!GOV-CHRIS-CHRISTIE: Happy to be back , David . @!MR-GREGORY: Here , a top supporter of Governor Romney . Let me pick up on the news here . The governor made a decision to release his tax records . Should he go back further than that ? Will he go back further than that ? @!GOV-CHRISTIE: Now listen , I think what people want to see is get a look into how Governor Romney has made his money , how much he 's made and look at his tax returns . I think that 's perfectly appropriate and I think you 'll get a good view of that both in the most -- two most recent years , in 2010 and 2011 . And I think he 's done a good job by making the decision this morning to put them out and I 'm happy he 's doing it . @!MR-GREGORY: He waited . It made for a pretty bad week . You had advised him earlier in the week to do it sooner . I want to show something from the debate this week when he sort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ release more and release more sooner than when he planned to last April . @!GOV-CHRISTIE: Sure . @!MR-GREGORY: This is what he said . @(Videotape-Thursda @!FMR-GOV-MITT-ROMNE: I want to make sure that I beat President Obama and every time we release things drip by drip , the Democrats go out with another array of attacks . @(End-videotape) @!MR-GREGORY: Is there something in the tax returns that will hurt Governor Romney ? @!GOV-CHRISTIE: I do n't believe so , no . And I think , listen , at the end of the day , you know , David , even in a , even in a standard tax return , adversaries like the Obama White House will try to pick it apart and make something bad about the success that Governor Romney 's had in his life . So I 'm sure that 's what he was concerned about . But listen , I made my position really clear both publicly and to Governor Romney that I think he should release the returns . He 's releasing them . And so , you know , now it 's time to move on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see is someone who 's been extraordinarily successful in his life and I do n't think the American people want a failure as president . I think they like somebody who 's succeeded in whatever they 've tried to do . And I think that 's what you 're going to see with Governor Romney. @!MR-GREGORY: What is the meaning of last night ? @!GOV-CHRISTIE: Listen , it 's clearly disappointing . I -- you know , I 'm not going to say that last night was somehow good news for the Romney campaign . Listen , we had a bad week as a campaign and a bad result last night . So , you pick yourself up , you dust yourself off and you get to Florida and you fight . And I still believe that Governor Romney 's going to win in Florida on the 31st and that he 's going to return to Florida in August as the Republican nominee . @!MR-GREGORY: There 's a couple of big issues connecting to conservatives in the party , the grass roots of the party , and what Speaker Gingrich says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to show something that you discussed with Oprah Winfrey on her program as a liability for Governor Romney and have you talk about it a little bit more . @(Videotape-last-Su @!GOV-CHRISTIE: I have a real sense that Governor Romney has a real depth of knowledge and experience and understanding about government and business , but he does n't really communicate it all that well . I think people have a hard time connecting at times wit him . And so his challenge is going to be how to connect with people , how to make them feel what I do believe he feels inside . @!MS-OPRAH-WINFREY: Mm-hmm . @!GOV-CHRISTIE: Which is he wants to do great things for the country . @(End-videotape) @!MR-GREGORY: What do you attribute that lack of connection to ? @!GOV-CHRISTIE: Listen , he 's a very reserved guy . And I think everybody comes with a different personality . I 'm obviously not reserved , he 's very reserved . Everyone can have success in politics with different personalities and every candidate , David , has liabilities . I mean , you know , the fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's got a lousy record for the last three years that he 's not going to be able to defend or run on , so he 's going to have to attack Mitt Romney . The speaker , and I heard his comments just now , a strategic adviser , that is the oldest Washington dodge in the book . That 's because he did n't want to register as a lobbyist . @!MR-GREGORY: You 're talking about when he worked for Freddie Mac . @!GOV-CHRISTIE: Of course . He got paid $1.6 million . First , he said he was a historian , now he 's a strategic adviser . I mean , let 's be serious . It 's the oldest dodge in the book . He was using his influence that he obtained in public office to try to help them . That 's why they paid him $1.6 million . He can call it whatever he wants to call it , but that 's what it is . So every candidate will have liabilities . And what I was saying to Oprah in that interview was it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evolve , people meet those challenges . And I believe Mitt Romney will meet that challenge and he will connect . @!MR-GREGORY: So you come back , though , to connection with conservatives . What , in your judgment , is Mitt Romney 's greatest contribution to the conservative cause ? @!GOV-CHRISTIE: Well , listen , this is a guy who has shown that the American free enterprise system can work and can work to create jobs across America . You look at places like Staples and Sports Authority , everybody who goes to work at those places today has Mitt Romney to thank for it . And he 's going to know how to do that as president , to get government out of the way , to be able to let the private sector create those jobs that we so desperately need and have n't had in the Obama administration . That 's his greatest contribution to the conservative movement , to show that the American free enterprise system , which is under attack by the Obama administration , does work for people -- for real people , middle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people going to work at Sports Authority and Staples today , David , those are n't the elite . Those are middle class Americans who are using those jobs to put food on the table and keep a roof over their heads and send their kids to college . Let the president attack that . @!MR-GREGORY: When , when I moderated the debate in , in New Hampshire , I asked the candidates on the stage why should n't Mitt Romney be the nominee ? What 's disqualifying about his record ? So now I ask you as a member of the establishment , right ... @!GOV-CHRISTIE: Uh-huh . @!MR-GREGORY: ... why should n't Newt Gingrich be the nominee of this party ? What 's disqualifying about his record ? @!GOV-CHRISTIE: Well , listen , the fact of the matter is from my perspective , not as a member of the establishment , David , but as a governor , I know that we do n't need another legislator in the Oval Office . We 've had one for the last three years who does n't have the first idea of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together . We 've had the worst years of Congress in my lifetime because this president refuses to get in the room , roll up his sleeves and get the hard work done . We do n't need another legislator in the Oval Office who does not know how to use executive authority . We need an executive , someone who both in private sector and as a governor understands how to bring people together and use executive power . The speaker simple does n't have that experience . @!MR-GREGORY: You 've been more pointed , though . @!GOV-CHRISTIE: He 's never run anything . @!MR-GREGORY: You 've been more pointed when you talk about in favor of Governor Romney . You say he will never embarrass you . Do you think Newt Gingrich will embarrass the party ? @!GOV-CHRISTIE: I think Newt Gingrich has embarrassed the party over time . Whether he 'll do it again in the future , I do n't know . But Governor Romney never has . @!MR-GREGORY: You say he 's embarrassed the party . How and where do you worry he might do it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , David , we all know the record . I mean , he was run out of the speakership by his own party . He was fined $300,000 for ethics violations . This is a guy who 's had a very difficult political career at times and has been an embarrassment for the party . You remember these times , you were here . So the fact of the matter is , I do n't need to regale the country with that entire list again except to say this . I 'm not saying he will do it again in the future , but sometimes past is prologue . @!MR-GREGORY: Well , so , is this an issue that Governor Romney now makes more strongly ? Is character an issue in this campaign ? @!GOV-CHRISTIE: I 'm not talking about character . I 'm talking about how you conducted yourself in office and what that record indicates . I 'm not talking about the speaker 's character . I take him at his word that he 's a changed person . And I 'm not attacking him on that , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who 's never run anything , and never having run anything , I do n't think on the job training should be the presidency of the United States . I 've great respect for what he 's done for our party . He 's done some great things for our party over the years , and for our country . But the fact of the matter is , I do n't believe his record stacks up to Governor Romney 's record in that regard . @!MR-GREGORY: What about this electability question ? I mean , you heard what , what , what I challenged Speaker Gingrich with , which is there is this view in the party that if Gingrich keeps on going and if he consolidates support among conservatives , this is the best news for President Obama possible . Is that your view ? @!GOV-CHRISTIE: Well , my view is the worst news possible for President Obama is a Romney candidacy because Governor Romney will show with the executive experience he has , with the record he created in Massachusetts , and with the values he 's articulating , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of years , the best contrast we can have to President Obama . So I think Governor Romney would be the worst news for the Obama White House . @!MR-GREGORY: But do you think that a candidate , a nominee Gingrich could also beat President Obama ? @!GOV-CHRISTIE: Listen , could he ? Sure . @!MR-GREGORY: You do n't sound as convincing , though . Certainly not about Romney , whom you support . But ... @!GOV-CHRISTIE: What , I answered , I answered your question . @!MR-GREGORY: But you think he could ? @!GOV-CHRISTIE: Sure . @!MR-GREGORY: I want to ask you something that I do n't think has come up in this race so far , and that is whether you would consider being on the Romney ticket as , as a VP . You 've answered this a bunch of different times , but I want to ask it a slightly different way . You , you have said that you did n't feel that you were ready to be president right now . @!GOV-CHRISTIE: Right . @!MR-GREGORY: Would you be ready to be vice president ? Would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were going to accept a slot on the ticket ? @!GOV-CHRISTIE: Sure . Hey , listen , everybody 's misunderstood what I meant about saying being ready for president . I meant that , you know , being ready to leave the job that I had and being ready to run for president of the United States with all that entails . I did n't want to do , did n't feel ready to do it , and I think you have to be absolutely committed and ready to do that . Now as for the vice presidency , let me say again , I want to be governor of New Jersey . I ran to be governor of New Jersey . I absolutely believe that come November 2012 I 'm going to be governor of New Jersey and not in any other office . The fact of the matter is , if Governor Romney , who 's going to be our nominee , picked up the phone and called me to talk about this , I love my country enough and I love my party enough to listen , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ betting guy -- and I know you are , I know you are , David . If you 're a betting guy , you should bet Chris Christie being the governor of New Jersey in November 2012. @!MR-GREGORY: But you said once , who would want me as a number two ? @!GOV-CHRISTIE: Well , I still feel that way . @!MR-GREGORY: But you 'd be a good vice president , would n't you ? @!GOV-CHRISTIE: Oh , listen , I think that certain personalities ... @!MR-GREGORY: Not to appeal to your ego or anything . @!GOV-CHRISTIE: No , listen ... @!MR-GREGORY: I 'm saying you 'd be wonderful , would n't you ? @!GOV-CHRISTIE: Listen , I think certain personalities are suited for jobs better than others . And I do n't know that I 'm the guy to stand behind , three feet behind somebody and nod my head . It 's not necessarily in my character . But again , you know , you have to balance that against your love for your country and your love for your party and all the rest of those things . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gets to decide that question . That 's the nominee of our party . And if I 'm -- if I 'm approached I will listen . But my inclination , to make it very clear , is I want to stay governor of the state of New Jersey . But I think it 's wrong to foreclose that and to foreclose the nominee of our party from coming and talking to you about it because they may have a whole different view than I do and maybe they can convince me of something different . @!MR-GREGORY: I want to ask you about the State of the Union and also about New Jersey . First , on the State of the Union , what do you think the president could say that would surprise Republicans and galvanize Republicans to try to work with him on something substantial , even though it 's an election year ? @!GOV-CHRISTIE: He could finally embrace Simpson-Bowles . He asked for it , he put it on the shelf for purely political reasons , he showed political cowardice by doing it , and an absolute fear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think if he came out on Tuesday and said , " You know what , I was wrong to put Simpson-Bowles on the shelf . I should take it off the shelf , I 'm going to send it to the Congress and I want to have a vigorous debate and discussion about really tackling debt and deficit in our country in an honest and forthright way , the way Senator Simpson and Mr. Bowles suggested . " It 's not that I agree with every part of Simpson-Bowles , David , but it is a realistic plan that merits consideration and discussion . He never did it . That would surprise the nation if he did it , and I think it would show great leadership if the president was willing to do it . @!MR-GREGORY: Where have Republicans been culpable for the paralysis in Washington ? You 've spoke about the president . What about ... @!GOV-CHRISTIE: I 've spoken about both , David . @!MR-GREGORY: ... what , what role do Republicans play ? @!GOV-CHRISTIE: Listen , you know , and I 've said this before . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too much time talking at each other and not talking with each other . Look at New Jersey . Now in New Jersey I have a Democratic legislature . They say some of the most unspeakable things about me publicly . On the other hand , though , I do not take that personally . I still bring them in the room . We sit down , we talk and we resolve things because we 're put in these jobs to accomplish things , not just to posture and pose . And so my point to Republicans has been to you 've got to force those conversations . Now if the president 's not interested in having them , and if he 's not interested in developing those relationships , then there 's little the Republicans can do . But to the extent that we 've contributed to not having those relationships happen , then there 's a culpability there . @!MR-GREGORY: You talked about the State of the State and how you see New , New Jersey in the future . One of the things we 've talked about at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ federal state tunnel project which you were opposed to , you said , " Look , we 're broke in New Jersey . " And now you 're calling for a 10 percent cut in income tax , would cost the state $300 million a year over three years . Why can you afford that ? @!GOV-CHRISTIE: Well , because first of all the tunnel project was going to cost us an additional 8 billion , so we still do n't have that money to do it . It was a bad plan . And what we see is happening now is the federal government , New York , New Jersey , are working together to come up with another plan that will be more equitably shared by all the parties , not 75 percent of , 70 percent of the cost being on New Jersey . But the reason we need to cut taxes is think about what I inherited , David . I came in . We had $13 billion in deficits . We had had 115 tax and fee increases in the eight years before I became governor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country and the worst business environment in America . In two years , we 've balanced those budgets and brought ourselves to balance without any tax increases through very difficult , aggressive cuts . And now what I 'm saying is it 's time for the people to get some of their money back . Done reasonably , 10 percent cut phased in over three years , so you could do it reasonably and not bust the budget . Think about this , David , in New Jersey , the people of New Jersey are going to know for the next three years every year their taxes are going to go down . If I had told you that when I came here the first time , you would have told me I was nuts . But we did it because of hard work and sticking to our principles and working together with Democrats . I think we 're going to be able to do it again . @!MR-GREGORY: Do the New Jersey Giants win today ? @!GOV-CHRISTIE: Yes . You bet they do . @!MR-GREGORY: You did n't even flinch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New Jersey Giants . @!GOV-CHRISTIE: Of course they are . Listen , David , the only thing New York about the Giants in the NY in their helmet . They train in New Jersey , they play in New Jersey , and most of their players live in New Jersey . And so the New Jersey Giants are going to have a great game today . Sorry to my friends in San Francisco . It 's going to be a big win for the Giants today and on to the Super Bowl in New , in Indianapolis . @!MR-GREGORY: All right . Well , I 'll be watching for sure . I can tell you that . @!GOV-CHRISTIE: I 've got a bet on it , do n't you , David ? @!MR-GREGORY: Governor , thanks very much . @!GOV-CHRISTIE: Come on , tell me the truth . @!MR-GREGORY: Coming up , the 2012 Republican race for the White House is recast and all eyes now on Florida . Full analysis on the meaning of last night and what to look for in the week ahead from our political roundtable . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also got Republican strategist Mike Murphy . Also joining the roundtable , the BBC 's Katty Kay and NBC 's Chuck Todd . It 's coming up . Do n't go away . @(Announcements) @!MR-GREGORY: Coming up , a special Decision 2012 political roundtable . Full analysis on the meaning of South Carolina . Joining me MSNBC 's Joe Scarborough , Mike Murphy , the BBC 's Katty Kay and our own Chuck Todd . Coming up right after this brief commercial break . @(Announcements) ' 
##4103542 @!Mr-Speaker-last-w# @!FMR-REP-NEWT-GINGR: Well , David , thank you and the people of South Carolina were very generous and very hospitable and we really had a wonderful evening last night . @!MR-GREGORY: So what is the message that South Carolina has sent , and what does it mean for this race ? @!FMR-REP-GINGRICH: I think they sent two really big messages to -- which I wish the national establishment could pick up . The first is real pain . There 's tremendous unemployment , people really are hurting . The number of people who walked up to me who 've been out of work for a year , a year and a half . People who want to work hard , who want to have a better future , who want to provide for their families . That was really there . The second , though , which I think nobody in Washington and New York gets is the level of anger at the national establishment . People who are just sick and tired of being told what they 're allowed to think , what they 're allowed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as you know , in the two debates . The highest , the most intense passion in both debates was a head-on collision about what the news media was doing . And I think there 's something real and deep there that happens all across the country and that we 're seeing everywhere and certainly in Florida , which has had one of the most painful periods with housing mortgages and the price of housing and the difficulties in the housing area . As they look at the big boys on Wall Street they look at the guys in Washington , they know none of that help got down to average everyday Floridians . And I think that gap creates a real anger against the national establishment . @!MR-GREGORY: You are running against the establishment , you 're trying to run as an outsider . You talk about housing in Florida . You were a consultant or depending on your point of view , a lobbyist ... @!FMR-REP-GINGRICH: Right . @!MR-GREGORY: ... for one of the mortgage giants . I 'm wondering how you think you win that inside/outside game given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? @!FMR-REP-GINGRICH: ... wait a second , wait a second , David . David , you know better than that . I was not a lobbyist , I was never a lobbyist , I never did any lobbying . Do n't try to mix these things up . The fact is I was an adviser strategically and if you look at the only thing ever published by Freddie Mac I said , " You need more regulations . " If you look at the only article ever written about my talking to the Congress it was in The New York Times in July of 2008 and I said , " Do not give them any money . " Now I opposed giving money to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac . I think they both should be broken up into four or five much smaller companies . And I 've long felt that . And so I think that to jump from one to the other is simply wrong . In Florida my case is going to be very simple . You have a clear establishment candidate in Mitt Romney . Look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , look what he did in Massachusetts . And you have somebody whose entire career has been a Reagan populist conservative going all the way back to the 1970s . I think that 's a pretty clear contrast and I think Floridians would like somebody who speaks for them to Washington , not , not somebody who speaks to the establishment to them . @!MR-GREGORY: You 've raised questions about Romney 's business background , particularly his time at Bain . As he was conceding last night in South Carolina this is one of the shots that he fired across the bow . Listen . @(Videotape-last-ni @!FMR-GOV-MITT-ROMNE: Those who pick up the weapons of the left today will find them turned against us tomorrow . And let me be clear , if Republican leaders want to join this president in demonizing success and disparaging conservative values , then they 're not going to be fit to be our nominee . @(End-videotape) @!MR-GREGORY: The question , Mr. Speaker , after all of these questions about Bain , is there anything beyond the questions ? Where 's the beef , as was once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bain ? @!FMR-REP-GINGRICH: Well , I think , first of all , you do n't get any beef because you do n't get any answers . The fact is he is trying to cleverly hide behind an argument that no high school debater would ever let stand . The questions about the character , the judgment , the record of a presidential candidate , is not an attack on business . That 's silly . That would be like saying that my critique of Romneycare as resembling Obamacare means that I 'm against any kind of government involvement . That would be silly . The governor 's trying really hard to avoid answering anything whether it 's on his -- the Romneycare , for example , where the news reports are that they cleansed every single computer , we have no real record of how they developed it , and we have no real understanding of the overlap between his advisers and Obama 's advisers , although President Obama says they are the same people . So I think the governor keeps trying to make these kind of ad hominem arguments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he ca n't do better than that . @!MR-GREGORY: Mr. Speaker , if it appears likely now that Governor Romney will release his tax records , as you called for him to do last week , will you be satisfied and do you agree with him that there could be facts in there that both you and President Obama would use against him ? @!FMR-REP-GINGRICH: I do n't know . I mean , I think if there are things in there that can be used against him we better know it before the nomination . You do n't -- the last thing Republicans want to do is nominate somebody who collapses in September . Beating Barack Obama has to be the number one mission of the Republican Party . A second term for Barack Obama will be a disaster for this country and I am committed to beating him and I think I 've proven in the debates I could take him on in a series of debates and undo his billion-dollar campaign . And I think it 's very important that we have a candidate who 's strong enough and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a series of debates . @!MR-GREGORY: To give you your due on that electability question last night in South Carolina , you had the edge , not Governor Romney , who 's had the edge both in Iowa and New Hampshire . That 's important to say . Having said that , there are still real questions about your electability . Look at the most recent Fox News poll . Your unfavorability rating was still very high at 56 percent . And there are those that have worked with you , those that know you in the establishment who describe you as erratic or risky . This was something that Tom DeFrank wrote today in the New York Daily News . I want to put a portion of it and have you respond . " ' The winner in South Carolina was Barack Obama , a prominent Republican strategist glumly volunteered . ' This plays perfectly into his hands . We 've prolonged the process and that 's good news for the president . ' " It goes on . " ' Newt 's absolutely brilliant , recalled an admirer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 100 ideas ; 97 are real good , the other tree will blow up the world . So look for more party leaders currently ' neutral-for-Romney to get off the fence to inoculate against a Gingrich surge . ' Newt means losing 45 states , a Mitt-leaning GOPer told the Daily News . ' It would be a catastrophe for the country . ' " So that kind of sums up that establishment view of Newt Gingrich as the nominee . @!FMR-REP-GINGRICH: Well , the establishment is right to be worried about a Gingrich nomination because a Gingrich nomination means that we 're going to change things , we 're going to make the establishment very uncomfortable , we 're going to demand real change in Washington , real audit of the Federal Reserve , real knowledge about where hundreds of billions of dollars have gone . And I think if you look at a lot of these guys , they have really good reason to worry about an honest , open candidate who has no commitment to them , who has no investment in them . And I think they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not get along with it . On the other hand , everything they just said and that you read was said about Ronald Reagan in 1979 , 1980 . In ' 79 , Reagan was 30 points behind Carter . One of his Republican opponents described the Reagan economic growth plan as , " voodoo economics . " You know , some voodoo . It created 16 million new jobs . We came back and used the same model when I was speaker , it created another 11 million new jobs . So I 'm happy to be in the tradition of Ronald Reagan as the outsider who scares the Republican establishment and frankly after the mess they 've made of things maybe they should be shaken up pretty badly . And one of the things the Florida voters get to decide is do you want the establishment 's candidate , Governor Romney , or do you want somebody who stands for a conservative , populist approach that would profoundly change Washington . And that 's Newt Gingrich. @!MR-GREGORY: Mr. Speaker , you were outspoken this week about your views @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the past you 've said that they were fair questions . We 've had those conversations . Let me ask you more generally , if , if voters are going to consider your family values vs. the family values of Governor Romney , should they judge your conduct ? @!FMR-REP-GINGRICH: Sure , of course they should , and they should judge who I am . And I think the people of South Carolina did just that and they did it by a huge margin . And they repudiated the effort to go back and drag up things , particularly at the very opening of the national debate . Last night on stage Callista and I were together , we have a wonderful marriage . My two daughters and their husbands were there , they 're tremendous supporters . My two grandchildren were there , my chief debate coaches . Everybody who 's watched us knows I 'm a 68-year-old grandfather . I 've done things in my life that I regret . I 've had to go to God for forgiveness and reconciliation , but I have a great relationship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a great relationship with my grandchildren . And at 68 , I think I 'm the person best prepared to know how to get this country back on the right track . And I 'm the person who 's tough enough to take every single hit and keep coming and I 'll do the same thing as president and we will get America back on track with the help of the American people . I always ask them to be with me , not for me , because this is going to be a very , very difficult job . @!MR-GREGORY: Let me end with this , Mr. Speaker . Jeb Bush , former governor of Florida whose nomination is highly sought after , he says he 's going to stay neutral in the race , has called on all of the candidates to have a very positive tone and think about the independent voter as we move forward in the general election . I want to play something you said about President Obama last night and ask if you think you 're consistent with that admonition . Watch . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from which we draw our understanding of America . He draws his from Saul Alinsky , radical left-wingers and people who do n't like the classical America . @(End-videotape) @!MR-GREGORY: Can you win independent voters in a general election campaign with that message ? @!FMR-REP-GINGRICH: Absolutely . Ronald Reagan did it by a landslide in 1980 . He carried more states against Jimmy Carter than Franklin Delano Roosevelt carried against Herbert Hoover , and the reason 's simple : What I said last night is the truth . Nobody in the elite media wants to cover it . Nobody 's ever gone back and looked at what Saul Alinsky stands for . Nobody ever asks what neighborhood organizer meant . He was n't organizing Boys and Girls Clubs . He was teaching political radicalism . It explains his entire administration . He is who he is . It 's -- you know , it 's not that he 's a bad human being , my impression is that he has a good family , that he really loves his children and his wife , that he 's a very pleasant person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believes in a very radical vision of America 's future that is fundamentally different from probably 80 percent of this country . And nobody in the elite media has ever wanted to dig into it , ever wanted -- why would he veto the Keystone pipeline ? Why would he kill jobs in America ? Why would he have a National Labor Relations Board attack Boeing ? Because it fits the model of Alinsky radicalism . @!MR-GREGORY: Mr. Speaker , before I let you go , there 's news this morning . Governor Romney is saying on another network that he will release his tax returns on Tuesday from 2010 and an estimate for 2011 . Are you satisfied ? @!FMR-REP-GINGRICH: I think that 's a very good thing he 's doing and I commend him for it and I think it 's exactly the right thing to do . And as far as I 'm concerned , that particular issue 's now set to side and we can go on and talk about other bigger and more important things . @!MR-GREGORY: All right . Mr. Speaker , good luck on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thank you . ' 
##4103543 @!MATTHEWS , host : With us today , the National Journal 's Major Garrett , NBC 's Andrea Mitchell , The Washington Post 's Kathleen Parker and The Boston Globe 's Neil Swidey . First up , even with his bad last two weeks , full of slip-ups and slowed momentum , Mitt Romney still looks like the heavy Republican favorite . That means he 's got a 50/50 shot to win the White House this November . But a New York Times poll shows that half of the voters do n't know Mitt Romney well enough to support or oppose him . Who is he ? Well , today we look at Romney 's motivations for running and at his personality . First , let 's look at these three possible motivations for Mitt 's run . His father , George Romney , ran himself in 1968 , but dropped out when he slipped and said he 'd been brainwashed by the generals in a visit to Vietnam . Second , is Mitt Romney driven by ideology or philosophy ? And third , did he have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Or was it also always a foundation for politics ? Neil Swidey , you 're on the spot . You 've covered him for years for The Globe . Let 's get to some basics here . I grew up knowing , a lot of us here with George Romney , ran for president , looked like a real contender . And then he had that comment about the generals having brainwashed him into supporting the war . How much of the son is driven by the old man 's failure ? @!Mr-NEIL-SWIDEY-@1S: I think , Chris , it 's enormous . I think George Romney forms the central axis in Mitt Romney 's life . And that 's when you see him follow his father 's footsteps , from business leader to governor , to presidential aspirant . I was shocked . He had actually never seen the brainwashed interview . I showed it to him a few years ago when I was doing the profile of him and just to watch him and watch his face sort of dissolve and kind of relax is -- as seeing this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life . They never -- the Romney family sort of never looked back , but in his mind , I think , there is this idea that this is what he 's supposed to do to finish the job his father couldn't. @!MATTHEWS: Well , we had a president like that , George W. , who a lot of people -- it 's all psychobabble to some extent , but a lot of people believe that he tried to do a lot of things , like go into Iraq because his father did n't quote " finish the job . " Is it like that ? Is it that driven ? @!Mr-SWIDEY: Well , I think it 's more the path that he was set . I -- his father was never a president , so he does n't have that sort of record to correct or to alter from . And I do n't see the push and pull that you saw with George W. Bush and his father , the kind of difference . Although , when you get down into the relationship between George and Mitt Romney , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're two completely different people . Their operating systems are different . @!MATTHEWS: OK. @!Ms-KATHLEEN-PARKER: Yeah . I 'm so glad you ... @!MATTHEWS: I 'm going to go with Andrea on ... @!Ms-PARKER: Can I just interrupt here a minute ? I know that 's unlike me , but I mean , yeah , I think Freud would be fairly bored with this conversation . I do n't think there are these deep psychological motivations . I mean , we all want to please our parents to some extent , but I do -- as you say , I think they are -- these are two very distinct individuals and if there is a driving philosophy , I think it really comes down to duty . You have a -- you know , the Mormon Church has something to do with it . @!MATTHEWS: Yeah . Right . @!Ms-PARKER: But it was the way he was raised . @!MATTHEWS: Andrea , we 've seen so many guys , men in most cases , who come along after their father , they see their father having blown it one way or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for re-election . Al Gore 's father was defeated for re-election as a senator . People like Mario Cuomo , Andrew comes along . @!Ms-PARKER: Mm-hmm . @!MATTHEWS: His father was -- Pat Brown , Jerry comes along . It 's not like there 's any deep psychological weirdness here , it 's simply they 've learned it from experience and they 're not quite their old man because of that experience . @!ANDREA-MITCHELL-re: And I do n't think it 's so much Freud , I think it is sort of history , biography and it is , as you say , maybe it 's all of the above . @!Ms-PARKER: Mm-hmm . @!MITCHELL: It 's completing with the father has not finished . It is the path , it is duty . Yes . Faith . And I was so struck in seeing on the trail that when Mitt Romney gets on the bus , the first thing you see is the picture of George Romney . Who puts the picture of their father up ? George W. Bush did n't . You do n't see Bush 41 decorating the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see John McCain , whose father was also a huge influence ... @!MATTHEWS: Yeah . @!MITCHELL: ... showing his father off . So I think that is really compelling and it is completing the family -- the family history . @!MATTHEWS: Yeah . I do n't think it 's " Don Giovanni , " some grand old father , august frightening father figure coming back to judge you . @!MITCHELL: It 's much more benign than that . @!MATTHEWS: But let 's go to Major . This whole question of goal-driven . Although he has the ambition to be president ... @!Mr-MAJOR-GARRETT-@: Sure . @!MATTHEWS: ... although he may have inherited it , he seems to have , there 's still the oddness about him . He seems to have the goal , but not the instinct to be a politician . @!Mr-GARRETT: His political instincts do seem limited . I had a conversation last week with Peter Hart , a very successful Democratic pollster , and he has a question he likes to introduce to people about presidential candidates . If they 're your neighbor , what words come to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most people 's minds ? High hedges . @!Ms-PARKER: Neatly trimmed . @!Mr-GARRETT: High hedges . @!MITCHELL: That 's a classic Hart , Peter Hart focus group , is n't it ? @!Mr-GARRETT: All right . And that 's the kind of impression people have of Mitt Romney. @!MATTHEWS: That 's wonderful . @!Mr-GARRETT: Which contrasts from the people I 've talked to who know Governor Romney really well , that he 's exceptionally personal -- personable , generous , and has a warmth about him , but like we 've encountered all in American political life , there are some people who are that way naturally , but they project that . They do n't carry that off on a national stage , or even a statewide stage in Massachusetts . I think that 's one of the big impediments for Governor Romney. @!MATTHEWS: Yeah , let me ... @!MITCHELL: One quick thing . It 's partly the way he was raised and when you look at the way he went to college . When he was at Harvard Business School , he was living in the suburbs , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was never an undergraduate living with other kids and dealing with that , not even in that first year at Stanford . Right . @!MATTHEWS: High hedges . I just love this idea , this suburbanite . Let me ask you about his philosophy because , I mean , his critics have said he does n't have one . People who 've worked with him , people who now I 've talked to worked with him say he 's data-driven . He 's almost like an investment banker , a young person , constantly trying to find information . Is he data-driven or does he have some basic philosophical notion that he 's trying to follow ? @!Mr-SWIDEY: I think what you see with Romney , and you see this -- his governing style most clearly in his first two years as governor of Massachusetts . He was the best and brightest guy . He brought in people irrespective of party , he wanted to tackle big issues . Health care , the biggest of them . He was interested in solutions . He 's an input-output guy . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deal with an issue that we all know , we talk about all the time on this program , everybody in America talks about it , the threat from Iran ? How would he decide whether to bomb Iran or let Israel bomb Iran ? How would he do that ? @!Mr-SWIDEY: Well , the question with Romney and this is the big question , is it 's that what input-output is he most focused on ? He changed completely after two years as governor because he began interested -- became interested in running for president or at least following through on a long interest on that . And then the inputs and outputs were all about what 's going to play for his national race . So that old issue , this happened with Clinton when he was in office . Are you more concerned with politics or are you more concerned with the actual execution of government ? And that 's the big question for him . @!Mr-GARRETT: And I think this is a central question when voters evaluate Governor Romney as a potential president . Yes , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and how do you have a strategy to achieve that goal when you do n't -- or you may not have or voters may question whether or not you have an instinct for the human -- the human beings involved in politics ? @!MATTHEWS: And leading people . @!Mr-GARRETT: That 's -- and leading people and evaluating people across the table or across the globe . @!MATTHEWS: Let me ask you about the money . I do n't know any politician like him who has this really intent knowledge of money , a pecuniary interest to make a quarter billion dollars , which I respect as an ability , certainly . And also have this ability to be a leader of people . They seem to be two different parts of the brain . @!MITCHELL: You 're right . I ca n't ... @!MATTHEWS: What 's drive -- what 's he got ? @!MITCHELL: I ca n't think of someone else with his particular biography because he does n't have that connection to people . When you see him out on the trail , he does n't seem to relate to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picking up with his focus group . And in the way he made money , it was n't manufacturing like his father , an iconic car , the Rambler . It is n't a product . It is both ... @!Mr-SWIDEY: And his father never respected his -- never understood how he made his money and that was one of the things that I think Mitt struggled with . @!MATTHEWS: @(Unintelligible) ... people . @!MITCHELL: That 's right . It 's investment banking , but it 's more so the leveraged buyouts . That was really the larger part of the career was leveraged buyouts and that 's not a productive form of capital creation other than making money . @!Ms-PARKER: @(Unintelligible) @!MATTHEWS: Yeah . Well , let 's -- we 've got to keep moving . Let 's go down into what Romney is like . The old question , what 's he like ? Here are three key questions about that . @!Ms-PARKER: @(Unintelligible) @!MATTHEWS: One , what is this distance thing people are always talking about ? He 's got all this distance from people . And is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And finally , what would happen if he lost ? In other words , how important is this race for him to win ? I 've got to get back to you again , Neil , the distance thing . Everybody says that . Well , you want to go in on this , Kathleen ? @!Ms-PARKER: I 'm dying to talk . @!MATTHEWS: Go on this . @!Mr-SWIDEY: Go , please . @!MATTHEWS: Why does he seem so opaque ? People say he looks through you when he talks to you . @!Ms-PARKER: Well , I 've spent time with him , a little bit , and he does n't look through you , I do n't think . He 's very warm . That may be , you know , he just likes me better than he likes these other people . I 'm kidding . But you know , I think we 're missing something here . When you talk about his leadership abilities , I mean , one of the things I 've noticed about Mitt Romney is that he has a core group of people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inner circle are very fine people , I 'm sure you know some of them . They are devoted to him . @!MATTHEWS: Yeah . @!Ms-PARKER: And his inability to convey that kind of leadership to the -- to the public at large has something to do with his -- just his sort of , I think , sort of endearing awkwardness. @!MATTHEWS: Well , that 's ... @!Ms-PARKER: To get right down to his core group ... @!MITCHELL: Does it remind you of Barack Obama ? @!Ms-PARKER: ... he has a leadership -- he is a leader among his own -- the people who know him well . @!MATTHEWS: Major , when you interview him with a pen , without a microphone , is he more -- is he more real ? @!Mr-GARRETT: No . I think he 's exactly the same . I 've interviewed him on camera and off camera . He strikes me as the same analytical , cautious . Unlike his father , who was more brash . @!Mr-SWIDEY: Yeah . @!MITCHELL: Right . @!Mr-GARRETT: More go for the jugular , Mitt is -- Governor Romney @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother . @!Mr-GARRETT: He strikes me as very much the same person on and off camera , which is not necessarily opaque , just a bit ... @!Ms-PARKER: Guarded . @!Mr-GARRETT: Exactly . @!Mr-SWIDEY: But what happens off camera is the skill-set that he has works . I mean , he 's analytical , but he 's actually human and he connects with you and he can -- and he can have a conversation with him . On camera , he 's thinking . You see the machinery working of what is this -- how is this going to play ? What 's going to happen here and he stiffens up . @!MITCHELL: Is n't there an analogy , though , to Barack Obama surrounded by a loyal group of people and a little bit removed . There 's always the reserve . It 's so interesting to see these two figures who may well be facing off against each other . @!Ms-PARKER: You 're right , Andrea . @!MITCHELL: Both having this one critique that they do n't connect one-on-one. @!MATTHEWS: Well , he 's got to be more -- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know this , whatever they are when they 're running , they 're going to be more of when they get in there . @!MITCHELL: It exaggerates all these qualities . @!MATTHEWS: If he 's remote now , he 'll be more remote in there . If he 's analytical now , he wo n't be a big philosopher leader . He 'll be an analytical leader . He 'll become somewhat boring like Obama 's been somewhat boring . @!Mr-GARRETT: Yes , but I would say one thing that separates the two of them . I think , as a candidate , I very distinctly got the impression , I think the country did , too , that Barack Obama was very comfortable with his narrative . He wrote his narrative and he carried his narrative into the American experience . @!MATTHEWS: Yeah . @!Mr-GARRETT: Governor Romney knows his narrative , but is not nearly as viscerally comfortable with it himself and that 's why he has a hard time conveying it comfortably and persuasively to the American public . @!Ms-PARKER: Well , and maybe that 's partly -- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , people have come -- that 's been a point of tension for him . @!MITCHELL: Trying to de-emphasize it . @!Ms-PARKER: Exactly and yet , his Mormonism is very much a part of the kind of person he has become and those are his best qualities . @!Mr-SWIDEY: His two subcultures that he merges from , Mormonism and private equity finance , are mysterious , opaque worlds to a lot of Americans and he has had trouble conveying that and making that seem approachable to the vast Americans . @!Ms-PARKER: Exactly . @!MATTHEWS: Yeah . Well worded , well stated . We 're going to take a break right now , but a crutch for Romney when he 's attacked as the heartless job killer is one of his success stories at Bain Capital , Staples . Romney can count on every TV viewer being completely familiar with the Staples tag line , " well , that was easy . " Coincidentally , some say that being Mitt is easy . So maybe his campaign ad team might imagine the Mitt luck as a political selling point . Something like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When we come back , the super-duper rich who are funding the super-duper PACs dedicated to defeating Barack Obama . Plus , scoops and predictions right from the notebooks of these top reporters . Be right back . @(Announcements) @!MATTHEWS: Welcome back . This week we learned the Obama team is short of cash . They 're struggling to be competitive with the Republican attack machine that 's coming . Here are just a few of the big money-types fueling that anti-Obama machine . David and Charles Koch , the Koch brothers with an oil fortune , not to mention lumber and paper . They pledged to raise and spend $200 million to beat Barack Obama . Then there are the multimillionaire donors to Karl Rove 's super PAC , that graphic shows just three of the biggest , including Bob Perry , the guy whose sunk John Kerry by funding those Swift Boat ads back in ' 04. @!TEXT: Bob Perry Jerry Perenchio Robert Rowling $3 Million $2 Million $1 Million @!MATTHEWS: Andrea , this ability to raise enormous amounts of money , spend enormous amounts of money , put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on one or two issues affecting the candidate you do n't like , it 's new . @!MITCHELL: It 's new . It came really not just from Citizens United , that was one case . Then two days later there was an Appeals Court case , Speech Now , which expanded it . And basically what it says , I mean , individuals could always spend an unlimited amounts of money , but they said that independent groups could with not prompt disclosure . So there 's no transparency and it changed the climate . We saw what happened in Iowa . Newt Gingrich is absolutely correct , the Romney supporters just smeared him with unanswered ads and that is what propelled Mitt Romney , you know , with a better than expected Iowa showing into New Hampshire , changed this trajectory of this campaign . @!MATTHEWS: @(Unintelligible) ... @!Mr-GARRETT: Those involved in politics ... @!MATTHEWS: ... on the Solyndra thing . I 've got to point out , they 've spent $6 million on this Solyndra -- anti-Solyndra , hitting Obama for a subsidy that he gave to an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad . And now they can just pick it out . @!Mr-GARRETT: And there was reason to believe it might , right . Look , on both sides , and there 'll be some Democratic money that will come into play on this , there 's something very linear and very direct about having money , going to a certain group , having them poll directly , advertise directly and show you what 's happening on the polling data in an immediate way . @!MITCHELL: Right . @!Mr-GARRETT: In the old way , you had to go through parties , you 'd call up , someone would call you back in a couple of weeks . Those in the business community and those on the labor side see the super PACs as a direct linear and accountable means of influencing political debate . That 's why they like them . @!MATTHEWS: This is like one of the telemarketers . They put an ad on the air in certain ZIP codes and then they pulverize it with ads and then they check to see how many sales they get . They can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like that and they absolutely can -- as we saw in Iowa , as Andrea said , I mean , it totally changed the whole election essentially and it will happen again . It 'll be interesting to see what they pull out to work against Obama . But what 's -- one little side bar to this is that a lot of the candidates themselves really do n't love the super PACs . In fact Romney said he 'd wanted to -- he 'd like to see them get , you know , disappear . @!MATTHEWS: Well , it destroyed Newt Gingrich for him out in Iowa . @!Ms-PARKER: True , but part of the problem is that sometimes these super PACs are really organized by people who have enormous egos and who are really kind of on a vanity trip of their own . That does n't necessarily always work best for the candidate . @!Mr-SWIDEY: But at the end of the ... @!MATTHEWS: But yeah , with the swiftboating . Let me tell you an example , we all know this , but here was John Kerry 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strength , that he had fought in the Vietnam War . And so many other candidates hadn't. @!Mr-SWIDEY: Yeah . @!MATTHEWS: And he was reporting for duty , remember all that at the acceptance speech ? @!Mr-SWIDEY: Yeah , yeah . @!MATTHEWS: And then they went right at that . @!Mr-SWIDEY: They did . And the big question I think is Obama . You know , here he was exactly two years ago talking to the Supreme Court in front of him calling out Citizens United . Now he has to make that decision , does he go with it or not ? And he 's obviously going to go with it more for survival , but I think everyone 's at the end of this campaign , may want to just take a shower because it 's going to have this bad feeling . @!MITCHELL: And in fact the Obama campaign has figured out immediately that the Solyndra attack worked . @!MATTHEWS: OK. @!MITCHELL: And they are now counterfighting -- counterpunching. @!MATTHEWS: OK . This is going to depress voting . Negative advertising depresses the amount of people who show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for that reason historically , just lower voting turnout . When we come back , scoops and predictions right from the notebooks of these top reporters . Tell me something I do n't know . Be right back . @(Announcements) @!MATTHEWS: Welcome back . Major , tell me something I do n't know . @!Mr-GARRETT: Obviously , the president 's State of the Union is this week . It 's expected by Republicans to be partisan , but there are those in the Republican House and Senate who look to Jack Lew and remember back in ' 96 when he worked for Bill Clinton , very successful on policy and bipartisan compromises . They also know Bruce Reed is the vice president 's chief of staff . There is some glimmer of hope some work might get done this year . @!MATTHEWS: Because he 's the new chief of staff for the president . @!Mr-GARRETT: Yes . Indeed . @!MITCHELL: And looking ahead to the next primary in Florida , 30 percent of the Hispanic community is Cuban-American . That is a smaller proportion and so the Hispanic community there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mitt Romney 's really hard line on immigration . More prone to the Newt Gingrich approach to immigration . The other interesting little fact is about the Mexican Romneys . Those looking back at all those records say that Mitt Romney should look back on the records because the Romneys that came back from Mexico to the United States , they crossed the border illegally . @!MATTHEWS: Hm. @!Ms-PARKER: Ah . Well ... @!MATTHEWS: Kathleen : @!Ms-PARKER: ... you may have one-upped me on that one , Andrea . Everybody thinks Romney 's perfect . We know he does n't drink , he does n't have -- drink coffee , flawless . I have found a weakness . @!MATTHEWS: What ? @!Ms-PARKER: And I hope this is one thing you do n't know . Mitt Romney apparently has a weakness for Cool Whip . @!MATTHEWS: That 's it , huh ? @!Ms-PARKER: He has a lot of it . @!MATTHEWS: Mr. Excitement . Yes . @!MITCHELL: A lot of chemicals ... @(unintelligible) . @!Mr-SWIDEY: I do n't know where to go with that one . @!MATTHEWS: Whip up a lot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since 2008 when Mike Huckabee was blaming Romney and saying he 's the -- like looks like the guy that laid you off , the Democrats have loved this idea of Bain Capital as being an area to go . But I think they might realize that it 's not as clear a winner for them as they might think . Because when you drill down in the polling , it 's clear that America -- the vast majority of Americans blame both parties for having this cozy relationship with corporate America . @!MATTHEWS: Yeah . @!Mr-SWIDEY: They do n't see that as soak the rich , they see that as sort of level the playing field . @!MATTHEWS: OK , thank you . When we come back , the big question of the week . Does Barack Obama have enough time now to turn on the juice ? Be right back . @(Announcements) @!MATTHEWS: Welcome back . Tuesday night the president launches his political year with his State of the Union address . Which brings us to this week 's big question . Will he have the juice to run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Major : @!Mr-GARRETT: Of course he will . He 's going to run a very tough , aggressive campaign and I would say the speech on State of the Union will be an interesting governing speech . The political speech , the Osawatomie , Kansas , speech , that 's his re-election speech . @!MATTHEWS: OK . Andrea : @!MITCHELL: I agree with all of that . He 's going to have the money , he 'll have the juice . The question is , what other events are going to happen in the economy and Europe elsewhere that are going to change the whole climate for this campaign ? @!Ms-PARKER: Yes . @!MATTHEWS: Is he going to command the narrative this year ? Is he going to be telling the story of 2012 , President Obama ? @!Ms-PARKER: Well , he has an opportunity to do that , but the big point that you made about the European economy is huge . He has no control over that and that 's going to affect us and ultimately the economy and where we sit on Election Day . @!MATTHEWS: Sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a much more energetic campaigner than he is in government , so that 's going to be whether this engages him . @!MATTHEWS: Thank you very much . Great roundtable . Major Garrett , Andrea Mitchell , Kathleen Parker and Neil Swidey. '

When you heard that she had n't been at work the previous Friday or that Monday , did that strike you as odd ? @!NORB-WITT: Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said she 's never missed work without calling . @!NORB-WITT: Norb says we 're only two miles away . We 'll go check on her . @!RICHARD-SCHLESINGE: But Joanne 's boss was one step ahead of them . @!JUDI-WITT: He says I 've already called the sheriff 's . And he says Joanne had confided that she and Tylar had been having some problems . And he says we were concerned . @!NORB-WITT: I got in the car and got over there so fast , I think I was in a daze by the time I got there . There was two sheriff 's cars and two deputies that are out there walking around the house . And I said , well , I -- I -- I can -- I think I can get you in the house . @!RICHARD-SCHLESINGE: Norb unlocked the house , but the sheriff 's deputies ordered him to stay outside while they searched it . Before long , they told him Joanne was upstairs in her bedroom , and she was dead . @!NORB-WITT: They never said killed or murdered just -- they just said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on . But when the CSI van came in and -- and we had probably twenty detectives wandering around the place we knew that she had been killed . @!RICHARD-SCHLESINGE: Joanne had been stabbed about twenty times . @!LISETTE-SUDER: It was -- it was very , very , very gruesome scene . @!RICHARD-SCHLESINGE: Lisette Suder is the prosecutor on this case . @!LISETTE-SUDER: There was a wound that almost decapitated her , very violent . @!RICHARD-SCHLESINGE: Two or three days before that you had been on vacation , having the time of your life . @!NORB-WITT: Oh , yeah . @!RICHARD-SCHLESINGE: And , you know , like that everything changed . @!NORB-WITT: Yeah . @!RICHARD-SCHLESINGE: The news got even worse . Their fourteen- year-old granddaughter , Tylar , was nowhere to be found . @!JUDI-WITT: We did n't know if Tylar had been kidnapped -- @!NORB-WITT: Kidnapped . @!NORB-WITT: -- or -- @!NORB-WITT: We knew nothing . @!RICHARD-SCHLESINGE: Can you remember what you were feeling , I mean what -- @!JUDI-WITT: Oh . @!NORB-WITT: Shocked . @!JUDI-WITT: Just shock . @!NORB-WITT: Just shock . @!JUDI-WITT: Total , total . @!NORB-WITT: Shock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it did n't take detectives very long to conclude that Tylar was not a victim . Just weeks before Joanne had complained to authorities about her daughter 's relationship with a nineteen-year-old boyfriend Steven Colver . And now detectives wanted to talk to both of them . Colver and Tylar met at a coffee shop soon after she started ninth grade and he had started college . Norb Witt says it was n't long before Steven started influencing Tylar , and not in a good way . @!NORB-WITT: He had a fourteen-year-old that looked at him as God . I mean , he had total control over her . We knew that drugs were involved . We knew that a lot of drugs were involved . @!JUDI-WITT: Mm-Hm. @!NORB-WITT: They were into marijuana , ecstasy , cocaine . What does that do to someone 's mind ? @!RICHARD-SCHLESINGE: Just weeks after they met , Steven and Tylar convinced her mother to let Steven rent a room in their home . Joanne thought the two were just friends . They told her he was gay . And Joanne told skeptical friends Steven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mortgage . @!NORB-WITT: No one , every friend she had , everyone in the family did not want him in there . But Joanne was very strong willed . @!RICHARD-SCHLESINGE: So she let Steven move in , in April . But by May , Joanne was already suspicious . She came home one day and was shocked when she went to Steven 's room . @!LISETTE-SUDER: This is the room where it all began . @!RICHARD-SCHLESINGE: The prosecutor took us through the house . @!LISETTE-SUDER: And Joanne walked in and caught them in a compromising position . They had just or were about to engage in a sexual relationship . @!RICHARD-SCHLESINGE: Tylar was naked ? @!LISETTE-SUDER: Right . She was actually inside this closet , crouched down , covering herself , but naked . @!RICHARD-SCHLESINGE: Joanne did what any parent would do . She ordered Steven to leave and she called in two of her male co-workers to help throw him out . @!VINNIE-CATAPANO: And she said she was going to kick Steven out and she did n't want to be there alone . @!RICHARD-SCHLESINGE: Vinnie Catapano was one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the sidewalk and then confronted him . @!VINNIE-CATAPANO: The first thing I said to him is if it was me you 'd be in jail right now . @!RICHARD-SCHLESINGE: Joanne believed Colver had committed a crime -- statutory rape by having sex with Tylar , who was a minor . Joanne warned Colver she 'd call the sheriff if he did n't immediately stop seeing Tylar . Vinnie took a more direct approach . @!VINNIE-CATAPANO: I said if you make contact with Tylar again -- either by phone or in person -- I 'm going to hurt you . And I 'm going to hurt you East Coast-style , not West Coast-style. @!RICHARD-SCHLESINGE: What does that mean ? @!VINNIE-CATAPANO: I was trying to intimidate him . @!RICHARD-SCHLESINGE: Did he seem intimidated ? @!VINNIE-CATAPANO: Absolutely not . And that again annoyed me more . @!RICHARD-SCHLESINGE: Colver was also apparently not deterred by Vinnie or Joanne . @!VINNIE-CATAPANO: He snuck over to the house twenty times . @!RICHARD-SCHLESINGE: They continued their affair during the day when Joanne was at work and late at night when she was asleep . When Joanne found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authorities , who opened an investigation . @!LISETTE-SUDER: She wanted him away from her daughter . But they could n't stand the thought of not being together . And so that 's when the plotting began . @!RICHARD-SCHLESINGE: Within days , Norb Witt unlocked the house and sheriff 's deputies discovered the results of that alleged plot . Norb and his wife , Judi , now faced a terrible choice . Getting justice for the murder of their daughter meant turning their backs on their granddaughter. @!NORB-WITT: If she had n't done whatever she did her mother would still be alive today , probably . @!RICHARD-SCHLESINGE: And prosecutors say Tylar and Steven apparently did n't intend to stop with Joanne . They had more killing in mind . @(ANNOUNCEMENTS) @!RICHARD-SCHLESINGE: It was less than a month before her murder and Joanne Witt had had enough . She went to the sheriff to complain about Steven Colver 's sexual relationship with her underage daughter . That 's when Colver got this call : @!MAN-# 2 @(recording) : Have you ever had sex with her ? Have you ever had sex with Tylar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ detective . @!MAN-# 2 @(recording) : Okay . And what 's your relationship with her ? @!STEVEN-COLVER-@1re: She 's like a sister to me . I understand she 's fourteen . I understand all this . I 'm very , very scared at the moment . @!MAN-# 2 @(recording) : You can be honest because it -- it will look a lot better if you just come out clean . @!RICHARD-SCHLESINGE: But things were just getting worse for Tylar and Steven . Joanne discovered Tylar 's diary and prosecutor Lisette Suder says it could not be more incriminating . @!LISETTE-SUDER: It depicted very explicit writings of different sexual positions , different encounters , things that were -- made it very clear that in fact they had had a sexual relationship . @!RICHARD-SCHLESINGE: Joanne turned the diary over to the detectives and broke the news to her very angry daughter . @!MARK-RALPHS: She felt betrayed by her mother . @!RICHARD-SCHLESINGE: Tylar 's attorney Mark Ralphs. @!MARK-RALPHS: And -- and she was devastated . And she was very much afraid that he was going to go to prison . @!RICHARD-SCHLESINGE: Colver thought he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Joanne gave them . @!LISETTE-SUDER: In his mind , up to twenty years in prison for what Joanne had just done to him . @!RICHARD-SCHLESINGE: And Suder believes that 's when Steven and Tylar decided they had to kill Joanne -- even though Joanne had already turned over the diary . @!LISETTE-SUDER: They both made the decision that , yes , this is what we 're going to do . @!RICHARD-SCHLESINGE: Authorities believe the murder occurred late at night on Thursday , June 11th , after Joanne went to bed . @!LISETTE-SUDER: Her daughter let in Steven Colver . After they had made sure she was asleep , Steven got out a knife . @!RICHARD-SCHLESINGE: The knife was never recovered , but investigators believe it look something like this -- a ten-inch long chef 's knife . Suder believes it was Colver alone who stabbed Joanne in a particularly violent attack . @!LISETTE-SUDER: She 's laying right here . He starts stabbing her . @!RICHARD-SCHLESINGE: Wow . @!LISETTE-SUDER: Very brutal . @!RICHARD-SCHLESINGE: Mm-Hm. @!LISETTE-SUDER: She tries to fight back . She puts her hands up -- there 's a struggle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And that 's how she 's found -- with her legs over the bed . @!RICHARD-SCHLESINGE: Mm-Hm. @(Voiceover) : A bloody outline of the knife was left on the bed . @!LISETTE-SUDER: And ironically , in the nightstand next to the bed where she died , there was a book how to parent your out-of-control teenager . @!RICHARD-SCHLESINGE: After the murder , Suder says Tylar and Steven covered Joanne 's body with a blanket , turned down the air- conditioning to help preserve the body , locked up the house , and left . @!LISETTE-SUDER: I think how they acted afterwards is very shocking , that they were hanging out with their friends . They were kissing and holding hands along the street . They were living their life without Joanne . @!RICHARD-SCHLESINGE: But they did n't plan to live very long using logic only a teenager might understand Steven and Tylar allegedly killed Joanne so they could run off and kill themselves . They both believed Steven was about to be arrested for having sex with Tylar. @!LISETTE-SUDER: That 's when it led to how 're we going to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forever and eternally by killing ourselves . @!RICHARD-SCHLESINGE: How much thought did they put into this ? @!LISETTE-SUDER: Lots of great deal . I -- obviously , I do n't follow their logic . @!RICHARD-SCHLESINGE: But Steven and Tylar were following their plan . They went to San Francisco , rented this hotel room and ate a bizarre concoction of Fruit Loops , cake , and rat poison . It did n't work . And two days after Joanne 's body was found , with police hot on their trail , the teens were discovered by local officers changing their clothes behind a dumpster at a mall . They were both charged with murder . @!MAN-# 1 ( interrogation video ) : You 've been arrested for murder . @!TYLAR-WITT-@1inter: It 's not true . She 's not dead . She ca n't be dead . @!RICHARD-SCHLESINGE: It was n't long before Tylar ended the interrogation . @!TYLAR-WITT-@1inter: I want an attorney . I want you gone . How dare you . @!MAN-# 1 ( interrogation video ) : You want an attorney and you want me gone ? Okay , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk to you again . Good luck . @!RICHARD-SCHLESINGE: Detectives had a lot of questions for Tylar and Colver . And so did Steven 's mother . Jan Colver is convinced her son is innocent . @!JAN-COLVER: I remember when I looked at the autopsy photos . And I just remember gasping at the horrific nature of them . Steven is n't capable of that . @!RICHARD-SCHLESINGE: But Steven and Tylar both left incriminating suicide notes and Steven told two of his close friends that he murdered Joanne . @!LISETTE-SUDER: He went so far as to get into the trunk of his car and show the bloody knife . @!RICHARD-SCHLESINGE: And so he showed -- he showed the -- what you believe is the murder weapon ? @!LISETTE-SUDER: Correct . @!RICHARD-SCHLESINGE: It was Steven 's own words that helped convince prosecutors he actually stabbed Joanne Witt to death while Tylar stood by . When somebody says I did it -- @!DAIN-WEINER: Right . @!RICHARD-SCHLESINGE: -- and here 's the knife I did it with . @!DAIN-WEINER: Indeed . @!RICHARD-SCHLESINGE: That 's a problem for a defense attorney . @!DAIN-WEINER: Very much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He says Colver told his friends he killed Joanne to protect the real killer , the love of his life : Tylar Witt. @!DAIN-WEINER: He 's planning on being dead in several days so he 's not concerned about the consequences for him . His goal is to prevent her from being labeled as a -- a mother killer . @!JAN-COLVER: He would care about others before himself , to his detriment . Steven is the kind of guy who would drive off of a cliff or jump in front of a bullet or run into a burning home for a friend . @!RICHARD-SCHLESINGE: Even when he was interrogated shortly after his arrest , Colver was asking about Tylar. @!STEVEN-COLVER-@1in: You spoke with Ty ? How is she ? @!MAN-# 1 ( interrogation video ) : Better now . @!STEVEN-COLVER-@1in: She 's probably going through a lot . I 'm just worried about her . @!RICHARD-SCHLESINGE: But he probably should 've been worried about himself . His mother believes Steven has crippled his defense . And she told him so right after his arrest . @!JAN-COLVER: Why on earth would you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both crying . And he said -- he said I was in a different frame of mind . He goes I 'm so sorry , mom . And I said you do realize that your words will probably convict you ? @(ANNOUNCEMENTS) @!DAIN-WEINER: Steven 's not violent . He 's not aggressive . Tylar wrote in her diary about how she wished her mother would die in a horrible car crash . @!RICHARD-SCHLESINGE: Dain Weiner , who 's defending Tylar Witt 's boyfriend , Steven Colver , says while Colver had a clean record , there is plenty of evidence that shows Tylar was violent and more than capable of stabbing her mother . @!DAIN-WEINER: Every friend she had virtually she told that she hated her mother . She said if my mother does n't let me see Steven , I swear to God I will kill her . @!RICHARD-SCHLESINGE: For Tylar 's grandparents , it is almost impossible to believe . @!JUDI-WITT: Yeah , that 's cute . @!RICHARD-SCHLESINGE: Tylar was a beautiful baby when she was born . @!NORB-WITT: Tylar 's birth , as soon as she was born @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you know , the pictures . @!RICHARD-SCHLESINGE: Tylar was Norb and Judi Witt 's third grandchild . Happier times ? @!JUDI-WITT: Mm-Hm. @!NORB-WITT: Oh , yeah . @!JOANNE-WITT-@1home: Tylar -- I love you . She loves her papa . @!RICHARD-SCHLESINGE: Now times are very different . When you look at those pictures , given all that 's going on what happens in your heart ? @!NORB-WITT: It was hard . @!JUDI-WITT: Yeah . @!NORB-WITT: It really was . @!MAN-# 3 ( home video ) : Hey , hello . @!NORB-WITT: She was a wonderful mother . Just the affection , the care , her whole life centered around her daughter . @!JOANNE-WITT-@1home: I love you , too . @!NORB-WITT: No father involved at all . He was never in the scene . Joanne took Tylar everywhere . @!JUDI-WITT: Very , very close . @!RICHARD-SCHLESINGE: Everything changed , though , when Tylar was just five . According to Joanne 's best friend , Roxanna Jurgeit , Joanne lost control just for a moment . It happened when she was taking Tylar home from day care . @!ROXANNA-JURGEIT: They were on their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jo was having trouble concentrating on driving and being a safe driver . And she turned around and hit Tylar. @!RICHARD-SCHLESINGE: Later , when day care workers noticed a red mark in the shape of Joanne 's hand on Tylar 's face , they reported it to the state CPS , Child Protective Services , and Tylar was taken away from Joanne . She went to foster care for about a month until Norb and Judi could get temporary custody . @!JUDI-WITT: She lived with us for about six months where Joanne had to take classes . @!RICHARD-SCHLESINGE: What kind of classes ? @!JUDI-WITT: Anger management -- @!NORB-WITT: Anger management . @!JUDI-WITT: -- and parenting . @!RICHARD-SCHLESINGE: When Joanne got Tylar back things were very different in her house . @!JUDI-WITT: Now after that Joanne was afraid to even to discipline her that strongly . @!NORB-WITT: Yep . @!JUDI-WITT: Because she was afraid that Tylar would report her to CPS. @!NORB-WITT: So that cloud was always there , mommy , you know , I want to go out tonight with the boys or something like that . And I 'm going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mm-Hm. @!NORB-WITT: Yeah . @!JOANNE-WITT-@1home: Hi , Ty . What ? Ty , wait -- wait a minute . What 's wrong ? @!ROXANNA-JURGEIT: Tylar got into this behavior that she could do whatever she wanted . And there 's no consequence . @!RICHARD-SCHLESINGE: She watched as Tylar started getting into trouble at school . And she ran away from home several times . @!ROXANNA-JURGEIT: She was sweet when she was growing up . She was sweet . But I do n't know her now and I do n't want to know her now . @!RICHARD-SCHLESINGE: Roxanna says Joanne finally started trying to discipline Tylar more in the months before she was killed . And that led to fights -- violent ones . @!TYLAR-WITT ( home video ) : What are you doing ? @!JOANNE-WITT-@1home: Nothing . @!ROXANNA-JURGEIT: Things were starting to get physical between them . @!RICHARD-SCHLESINGE: The authorities , including Child Protective Services , got involved several times . Tylar told them her mother frequently got drunk and beat her . But Tylar was never taken from the house . @!ROXANNA-JURGEIT: There was no abuse . She was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And the authorities seem to agree . Prosecutor Lisette Suder says there is no evidence to support Tylar 's accusations . @!LISETTE-SUDER: If Tylar were truly beaten to the extent that is sort of assumed from the way Tylar speaks , there were never marks . There were never bruises . There were people around a lot and it never happened when any of those people were around . So was it something that happened just behind closed doors ? I do n't know . @!RICHARD-SCHLESINGE: But less than a month before the murder , Joanne and her daughter had a fight focusing this time on Tylar 's sexual relationship with Colver . Did she ever actually attack her mother ? @!DAIN-WEINER: She did . She threw some things at her mom . It was the day that she learned that her mother had reported the relationship to the police . @!LISETTE-SUDER: Actually , Tylar called the police pretending to be her mother saying my daughter 's out of control . Come and get my daughter . @!RICHARD-SCHLESINGE: It has to be one of the more bizarre 911 calls ever made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Excuse me . My daughter Tylar Witt had physically assaulted me and she 's vandalizing my home . @!RICHARD-SCHLESINGE: That 's Tylar impersonating her mother . She 's trying to get herself taken away by the sheriff . @!OPERATOR-@1911-rec: Do you feel safe being on the phone with me ? @!TYLAR-WITT ( 911 recording ) : No , I do not . She would not go back into her room and I tried to push her back into her room and we started to get into a fight and I am bleeding . @!RICHARD-SCHLESINGE: It is chilling evidence of a deeply troubled mother-daughter relationship . Joanne finally comes to the phone and she really is injured . The angry voice in the background is Tylar. @!JOANNE-WITT-@1911-: Hello . @!OPERATOR-@1911-rec: Yes . @!JOANNE-WITT: That was my daughter . @!TYLAR-WITT ( 911 recording ) : Go ahead finish the report and send me to jail . @!OPERATOR: Is your name Joanne ? @!TYLAR-WITT: Why wo n't you let me leave ? @!OPERATOR: Are you safe ? @!JOANNE-WITT: I do n't know . @!OPERATOR: Okay . Are you injured at all ? @!JOANNE-WITT: @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have deputies on the way . @!JOANNE-WITT: Thank you . @!RICHARD-SCHLESINGE: Why would Tylar try to arrange her own arrest ? @!LISETTE-SUDER: I have asked Tylar that question and she said she wanted to be anywhere but home . She would rather have been in juvenile hall than at home that day . @!DAIN-WEINER: Mom ended up with I believe a -- a cut on her chin , some bruises on her arm . @!RICHARD-SCHLESINGE: Joanne did n't need to go to a hospital , but Tylar was taken to juvenile hall . When Joanne refused to press charges , Tylar was released within hours and sent back home . @!MAN-# 4 : And also -- @!RICHARD-SCHLESINGE: Weiner questions why , with Tylar 's history of fighting with her mother , Steven is the one prosecutors say stabbed Joanne ? @!DAIN-WEINER: He has never hurt anybody or tried to hurt anybody or threatened to hurt anybody as contrasted with Tylar who has a very specific history with her mother . And has literally threatened to -- to kill her , to stab her , the very method by which she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grandparents -- were n't sure what to believe . Who did what to whom ? But Norb was convinced that Tylar was involved in Joanne 's murder somehow . @!NORB-WITT: She 's not my granddaughter anymore . @!RICHARD-SCHLESINGE: Your husband 's written her off , I mean -- is that -- pretty much , have you ? @!JUDI-WITT: I do n't -- @!RICHARD-SCHLESINGE: It 's a little harder for a grandmother . @!JUDI-WITT: Yeah , I think . She 'll always be in my heart . But it 's not -- it 's not the Tylar that we know today . It was the Tylar that I knew before . @!RICHARD-SCHLESINGE: I mean you 're writing off a -- a -- a girl , now a young lady , who you 've known since she was born . @!NORB-WITT: Yep . But she 's gone . I 've accepted it . @(ANNOUNCEMENTS) @!JUDI-WITT: It 's just very , very emotional to say the least . @!RICHARD-SCHLESINGE: For two long years since her arrest , Tylar 's grandparents have had nothing to do with her . But today , Norb and Judi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hall , where Judi finally plans to visit her granddaughter alone . @!JUDI-WITT: I had no expectations I guess . @!RICHARD-SCHLESINGE: It was tough to know what to say to their granddaughter accused , along with her boyfriend , of killing their daughter . @!JUDI-WITT: I said something about the horrendous act and we did n't know if you had done it or not or how much you were involved . And she just got this shocked look on her face and she says do you really think I could have done that ? @!RICHARD-SCHLESINGE: You believed her ? @!JUDI-WITT: I believed her . Mm-Hm. @!RICHARD-SCHLESINGE: Norb will wait a little longer to see Tylar. @!NORB-WITT: The two of them planned and killed our daughter . That 's the bottom line . We will never know the full story . @!RICHARD-SCHLESINGE: But Steven Colver 's lawyer , Dain Weiner , has a tangled story to tell . He says Steven was actually suicidal , not homicidal . He argues that Colver believed he was about to be arrested for statutory rape and his solution was to commit suicide along with Tylar. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pick her up , leave , go spend a few days down in San Francisco . And end their lives together . There was no discussion about killing mom . @!RICHARD-SCHLESINGE: Weiner says Tylar stabbed her mother , that Steven did n't know anything about it until Tylar called him to the house where he saw her with the bloody knife . @!DAIN-WEINER: Steven comes over . He comes in the house that 's when he sees her at the door with the knife . He said the knife was bloody . @!RICHARD-SCHLESINGE: Why can that not be true ? @!LISETTE-SUDER: He says that there 's blood dripping everywhere . There was no other blood found in the kitchen area or where he was saying this was happening . @!RICHARD-SCHLESINGE: There 's no blood on the carpet or on the floor . @!LISETTE-SUDER: None . @!RICHARD-SCHLESINGE: Leading up to the door ? @!LISETTE-SUDER: None . @!DAIN-WEINER: Do n't know . @!RICHARD-SCHLESINGE: Would n't you think there 'd be some evidence of -- of -- of blood somewhere besides that room ? @!DAIN-WEINER: And there -- and there may have been . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go through the house looking for blood drops . @!LISETTE-SUDER: There 's no physical evidence . There 's no logical evidence to support Steven Colver 's claim of what happened . @!RICHARD-SCHLESINGE: And prosecutors are counting on Tylar to help them prove that . There is one problem , though . Tylar is a liar . She lied several times to detectives -- most importantly to those who interrogated her right after she was arrested . @!TYLAR-WITT-@1inter: Who did I murder ? Who did I murder ? @!MAN-# 1 ( interrogation video ) : -- conversation . Your mother . @!TYLAR-WITT: What ? My mom 's dead ? @!MAN-# 1 : We 're , we do n't , we do n't need to play this . We already know that you know that your mother 's dead . @!RICHARD-SCHLESINGE: Overtime , Tylar gave up the act . And according to the prosecutor admitted she helped plan her mother 's murder . But she said Steven did the actual stabbing . And with that prosecutors struck a deal : if Tylar testified truthfully against Colver , she 'd get a reduced sentence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All the other evidence in the case that we have independently supports what she says . @!RICHARD-SCHLESINGE: But 48 HOURS found a witness who raises questions about Tylar 's role in the murder : one of her neighbors who never was interviewed by authorities . WO@!MAN-# 1 : Well , I was walking my little girl to go to the park . And I noticed that there was a young girl , young teen sitting on the swings . And she was just looking straight down . @!RICHARD-SCHLESINGE: The neighbor asked that we not use her name . Only after the murder she says did she realize she had been talking to Tylar Witt just months before the killing . WO@!MAN-# 1 : I saw a lot of sadness . She seemed angry to me . She seemed very cold to me . She just seemed very lost . @!RICHARD-SCHLESINGE: The neighbor got into a conversation with the young girl who complained that her mother drank a lot and the two got into fights . WO@!MAN-# 1 : I said to her what are you going to do to try to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again ? And she said there is not going to be a next time . Next time , it 's either going to be her or it 's going to be me . That statement alone ran chills through me. @!RICHARD-SCHLESINGE: When she heard there had been a murder in the neighborhood , she went to the crime scene and was seen on news footage talking to an officer . WO@!MAN-# 1 : And I said , sir , can you please tell me , did a young girl murder her mother ? And he just looked at me and -- and he said it 's a crime scene . @!RICHARD-SCHLESINGE: Did you know that this was Tylar 's house ? WO@!MAN-# 1 : I had no idea . @!RICHARD-SCHLESINGE: How did you jump to that conclusion ? WO@!MAN-# 1 : Because I never -- I never let go off the conversation that we had at the park . It weighed very heavy on me. @!RICHARD-SCHLESINGE: And now , as Steven Colver 's murder trial gets under way roughly two years after Joanne Witt 's killing , he will be together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to protect : Tylar Witt . But this time , the one-time lovers will point fingers at each other in court . @(ANNOUNCEMENTS) @!RICHARD-SCHLESINGE: As Steven Colver 's murder trial finally gets under way , his attorney , Dain Weiner , is ready and eager to argue that the wrong person is on trial . @!DAIN-WEINER: He does n't have a violent bone in his body . @!RICHARD-SCHLESINGE: But Tylar Witt , Colver 's former lover and self-confessed accomplice in the planning of her mother 's murder , tells prosecutors a different story . She outlines her gruesome version of the killing . She says she let Steven into the house and that he was armed with a chef 's knife . @!LISETTE-SUDER: Tylar went to the kitchen , got out her own knife and the two walked quietly up the stairs . @!RICHARD-SCHLESINGE: It was late at night and Joanne was asleep . @!LISETTE-SUDER: And they turn into Joanne 's room . He walks ahead , and just as he enters in , Tylar sees him making practice motions as he 's heading towards the bed . At that point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there at the opening of the door , covered her ears , he began to stab Joanne . @!RICHARD-SCHLESINGE: Prosecutors believe Tylar 's testimony , saying it 's corroborated by other evidence . Her lawyer , Mark Ralphs , also says she passed a polygraph test , helping to prove she did not stab her mother . Who decided that Joanne Witt had to die ? @!MARK-RALPHS: Well , Tylar indicated she could not remember whether it was initially her idea or whether it was Steven 's idea . @!RICHARD-SCHLESINGE: She could n't remember ? How do you not remember whose idea it is to kill your mother ? @!MARK-RALPHS: I do n't know . It had been more than two years -- @!RICHARD-SCHLESINGE: But Counselor , it 's the murder of her mother . @!MARK-RALPHS: I understand . @!RICHARD-SCHLESINGE: But Tylar has other credibility problems . One psychologist called her sociopathic . And on the stand , she testified she has two super beings living inside her : an angel named Alex and a demon named Toby . The demon she says takes control of her in times of stress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It gives a whole other personality , an aggressive , violent personality inside Tylar. @!LISETTE-SUDER: It had nothing to do with the murder . So it 's simply a defense attorney asking questions trying to show flaws in Tylar 's character . @!RICHARD-SCHLESINGE: And if jurors have trouble with Tylar , prosecutors have DNA evidence to offer . It was found on Joanne 's body and under her fingernails . @!LISETTE-SUDER: When there is DNA underneath the fingernails with the defensive wounds it is very likely that the DNA comes from Joanne trying to fight her attacker. @!RICHARD-SCHLESINGE: There was not enough DNA to identify anyone , but there was enough to prove it came from a male . @!LISETTE-SUDER: It really narrows it . Steven Colver 's a male . There 's only one male that we 're looking at . @!RICHARD-SCHLESINGE: Steven Colver 's trial lasted four weeks , but it took jurors took less than four hours to reach a verdict . @!JUDI-WITT: Hello . WO@!MAN-# 2 : Judi ? @!JUDI-WITT: Yes . WO@!MAN-# 2 : @(INDISTINCT) @!JUDI-WITT: We have a verdict . @!RICHARD-SCHLESINGE: What does it mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ news . @!RICHARD-SCHLESINGE: It depends whose side you 're on . @!DAIN-WEINER: I think that 's not a good sign . @!RICHARD-SCHLESINGE: Steven Colver 's lawyer Dain Weiner. @!DAIN-WEINER: I 've always been of the opinion that the longer they take , the better . @!RICHARD-SCHLESINGE: Weiner believes his young client is moments away from becoming a convicted murderer . You braced your client for that ? @!DAIN-WEINER: We discussed it . @!MAN-# 4 ( in court ) : Has the jury reached the verdict ? WO@!MAN-# 3 ( in court ) : We have . @!DAIN-WEINER: It 's -- it 's a -- a tense moment , tense moment . WO@!MAN-# 4 ( in court ) : We the jury , find the defendant , Steven Paul Colver , guilty of the crime of murder of Joanne M. Witt. @!RICHARD-SCHLESINGE: Colver is understandably shaken . He will end up in prison for the rest of his life . For reasons they would not discuss , prosecutors decided not to ask for the death penalty . @!JAN-COLVER: I just felt the air leave my lungs . @!RICHARD-SCHLESINGE: His mother Jan is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somebody to wake me up from the nightmare . @!RICHARD-SCHLESINGE: For a crime this brutal , the judge has no other choice . @!MAN-# 4 ( in court ) : The defendant shall be sentenced to life without the possibility of parole . @!RICHARD-SCHLESINGE: Tylar Witt -- the girl Colver planned to spend eternity with -- gets her reward for testifying against him . She 's allowed to plead guilty to second-degree murder -- @!LISETTE-SUDER ( in court ) : Are you doing it freely , voluntarily , because it 's what you want to do ? @!TYLAR-WITT ( in court ) : Yes . @!RICHARD-SCHLESINGE: -- and gets fifteen years to life . @!MAN-# 4 ( in court ) : This was a brutal murder . The court had seen no emotion or even remorse for the loss of your mother . And I 'm sorry for you , Miss Witt , because the person who loved you most in this world and without any reservation is gone . @!RICHARD-SCHLESINGE: There is enough heartbreak in this case to go around . And the last great tragedy is , it all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tylar and Steven murdered Joanne Witt because they feared he would be imprisoned for a long time for committing statutory rape . @!LISETTE-SUDER: It would have been a misdemeanor and the maximum that they -- he could 've received was a year in the county jail . Reality is he probably would n't have gotten any jail time . @!RICHARD-SCHLESINGE: Really ? So these kids thought it was the end of the world and -- @!LISETTE-SUDER: And it really wasn't. @!RICHARD-SCHLESINGE: But it is now the end of the free world for Colver . It 's the outcome Norb and Judi Witt hoped for . But , of course , there 's no satisfaction , no sense of victory for two people who lost a daughter and a granddaughter. @!JUDI-WITT: I really do wonder how we 've gotten through it . @!NORB-WITT: Yeah . @!JUDI-WITT: I really , really do . You just know that you can give up or you keep going . @!NORB-WITT: What 's your choice ? @!RICHARD-SCHLESINGE: You missed your daughter , of course . @!NORB-WITT: Absolutely . @!JUDI-WITT: Every day . @!RICHARD-SCHLESINGE: You think about her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . First thing in the morning , last thing at night . @!RICHARD-SCHLESINGE: Life has gone on for the Witts . And Norb , who once turned his back on Tylar , has now started to turn around to soften on the subject of his now seventeen-year-old granddaughter . You look at this little girl and then you -- you -- you -- @!JUDI-WITT: Mm-Hm. @!RICHARD-SCHLESINGE: -- look at the person that she is now . Do you wonder what -- what happened to this -- @!NORB-WITT: Yes . @!RICHARD-SCHLESINGE: -- little girl who you used to bounce around on your knee ? @!JUDI-WITT: All the time . @!NORB-WITT: Yes -- yes , all the time . @!RICHARD-SCHLESINGE: For years , Norb could not bring himself to see Tylar . But finally , after the trial he did . @!NORB-WITT: You heard the clanking of metal doors and then the door opened and she came in very meekly and said hi Pappa . She came over and hugged me and started sobbing . @!RICHARD-SCHLESINGE: Did you cry ? @!NORB-WITT: Oh , I do n't remember . But I held her pretty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see some remorse . @!RICHARD-SCHLESINGE: It is not easy to reconnect . And Norb is n't sure after everything that 's happened how close he can be to his granddaughter who helped murder his daughter . Have you forgiven her ? Have you -- @!NORB-WITT: No , I -- I have n't forgiven her at this point . @!RICHARD-SCHLESINGE: Do you want to ? @!NORB-WITT: I do n't know . Oh , yeah , probably deep inside I do but I do n't -- I do n't know if it 's possible . I do n't know . I really do n't know . And I do n't think Judi does either . @(Graphics-onscreen) Tylar Witt is not eligible for parole until 2024 . She will be 29 years old . Steven Colver is appealing his conviction .

And workers in Silicon Valley say they 're owed millions because of a secret deal among seven high-tech companies . Good evening . I 'm Maurice Dubois . The U.S. military is raising the ante in its stand-off with Iran . An aging warship is being upgraded to serve as a floating base in the Persian Gulf and the vital Strait of Hormuz . The move comes against a backdrop of escalating tensions over Iran 's nuclear program . National security correspondent , David Martin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could well be the beginning of the end game , U.N . inspectors left for Iran today , looking for answers to their suspicions about a secret nuclear weapons program . @!UNIDENTIFIED-MALE: We hope Iran will engage with us on the -- our concerns regarding the possible military dimensions of Iranian 's nuclear program . @!MARTIN: The three-day visit comes as the U.S. is rushing to upgrade this massive 30,000-pound bunker buster , which can be carried by a B-2 stealth bomber and would be used to attack Iran 's underground nuclear facilities if it comes to that . The bomb , shown here in mock-up on the manufacturer 's web site , has been in development for several years , but the discovery of this uranium enrichment complex dug into the side of a mountain nearly the holy city of Koom , has raised concerns that the device , called a massive ordinance penetrator , can not dig deep enough to destroy it . Israel , which regards the Iranian nuclear program as a threat to its very existence , has said there are only six to nine months left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be safe from attack . While the Pentagon tries to build a bomb that can penetrate that complex , the U.S. and its European allies , are trying to squeeze Iran with economic sanctions including a ban on imports of Iranian oil . Europe accounts for about one-fifth of Iran 's oil revenues . The pressure has triggered threats from Iran to close the Strait of Hormuz , through which nearly 17 million barrels of Persian Gulf oil pass each day . The U.S. has warned Iran both publicly and privately , it will not allow the strait to be closed . The Navy has now begun a crash project to convert this amphibious ship to a floating forward base that would be stationed inside the Persian Gulf and service as a mobile platform for mind sweepers , patrol boats , helicopters , and teams of commandos to keep the strait open . The ship is expected to arrive in the gulf this summer . @(END-VIDEOTAPE) @!MARTIN: The 2012 is shaping up as a decisive year in this long-simmering crisis over Iran 's nuclear program . And it 's all going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ campaign . @!DUBOIS: David Martin at the Pentagon tonight . Thank you very much .

Eye in the sky play a role in the hunts for pirates and their other hostages as Charlie D'Agata reports tonight from London . @(BEGIN-VIDEOTAPE) @!CHARLIE-D'AGATA-C: Despite the military firepower of 30 nations patrolling the coast of Somalia , pirate attacks are on the increase . In 2011 alone , Somali pirates hijacked 28 ships and captured 470 hostages , 15 of those hostages were killed . A 151 are still being held . The ransoms paid out amounted to more than $250 million . It 's an astronomical amount of money in one of the poorest countries in the world where the average salary is less than $300 a year . Piracy is big business and business is booming . @!Dr-Anja-Shortland-# @!UNIDENTIFIED-FEMAL: They happen to be two cities very closely associated with piracy . One being the source for the militiamen who provide the firepower and the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imported . D'AGATA : The satellite images reveal the sprawl , including a new mosque in a growing neighborhood and elsewhere , a new hotel . And even though just tiny specks not easily seen , she also found images of night time light , another giveaway . Electricity is a luxury in Somalia . Surprisingly , the coastal towns are left in the dark . @!UNIDENTIFIED-FEMAL: What I do n't see and what I did expect to see was the pirate villages on the coast lighting up like a string of pearls and there 's nothing . D'AGATA : Coastal villages have failed to benefit from any pirate booty . The brains and muscle of the operations merely use the villages to launch their attacks and keep their hostages well away from the coast . @(END-VIDEOTAPE) D'AGATA : American journalist , Michael Scott Moore is among those still held in Somalia . He was abducted last Saturday . Somali pirates had threatened to kill Moore if the United States attempts another Navy SEAL rescue -- Maurice . @!DUBOIS: Charlie D'Agata in London tonight . Thank you . Now to campaign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The latest poll shows Mitt Romney surging . He 's widened his lead over Newt Gingrich to nine points , 38 percent to 29 percent . And Jan Crawford and Dean Reynolds are with the candidates tonight . First to Jan in panama city . Jan , good evening to you . @!JAN-BREWER-CBS-NE: Well , good evening , Maurice . Sounding confident today , an energized Mitt Romney took his message and his allies right into the heart of what many say should be Gingrich country . That 's the staunchly conservative Florida panhandle. @(BEGIN-VIDEOTAPE) @!ROMNEY: I will fight with all my energy to keep America the strong nation it 's been and the hope of the earth and the shining city on the hill . @!BREWER-@1voice-ove: In Pensacola , Romney was greeted by big crowds and conservative supporters like Shirley McCraw. @!UNIDENTIFIED-FEMAL: We need somebody that has good morals and we need somebody as a role model . @!BREWER: For McCraw , that candidate is Romney , not Newt Gingrich. @!UNIDENTIFIED-FEMAL: It seems to me that every time he gets a new wife , he gets a new part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Panama City , Romney stayed away from Gingrich 's personal history , but hit him on ethics charges when he was House speaker . @!ROMNEY: He ultimately had to resign in disgrace . He ca n't rewrite history . @!BREWER: That message is resonating with panhandle voters like Frances Johnson . @!UNIDENTIFIED-FEMAL: We all forgive , we do , but I just can not vote for a man with that kind of baggage . @(END-VIDEOTAPE) @!BREWER: Now , with supporters like that , Romney was sounding even more optimistic this afternoon . After his event here , he said he thought things were going in his direction and that he was going to win on Tuesday . Now here 's my colleague , Dean Reynolds with the Gingrich campaign . @!DEAN-REYNOLDS-CBS: Jan , I 'm here in Orlando with Gingrich , and he is well aware that the polls here in Florida show him down , but he likes to point to other surveys , which have him ahead of Mitt Romney by six to nine points nationally . @(BEGIN-VIDEOTAPE) @!REYNOLDS-@1voice-o: Arguing that he is the true conservative in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Republican establishment . @!NEWT-GINGRICH-@1R@: Under the elites , the people who oppose me , some in the Democratic Party , some in the Republican Party , under these elites , we have become the America that couldn't. @!REYNOLDS: Gingrich bristles at criticism of his record , and especially charges that he was insufficiently devoted to Ronald Reagan 's policies of low taxes and small government . @!GINGRICH: Some fairly crazed people who are terrified I 'll become the nominee have been writing this genuinely whacked out things , some of which are that I did n't know Ronald Reagan , I was n't actually involved in the Reagan years . @!REYNOLDS: A feature of his rallies lately is the attendance of Romney campaign surrogates , including members of Congress , mingling with reporters and defending the former Massachusetts governor from Gingrich 's attacks . @!UNIDENTIFIED-MALE: Mr. Speaker , what do you make of all these Romney surrogates who are bird dogging your events day after day ? @!GINGRICH: It 's a free -- it 's a free country . @!UNIDENTIFIED-MALE: What do you think it 's a sign of by them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " desperation " come to mind ? @(END-VIDEOTAPE) @!REYNOLDS: Now Gingrich admits he was unhappy with his two debate performances this week , thrown off stride , he says , by what he calls Mitt Romney 's dishonesty -- Maurice . @!DUBOIS: Dean Reynolds in Orlando tonight . Thank you very much . @!CBS-news-political# JOHN @!DICKERSON , CBS NEWS POLITICAL DIRECTOR : That 's right . Mitt Romney is the one with the spring in his step now , unlike a week ago in South Carolina and Gingrich is off his game . With no more debates to allow him to remind people what they liked about him -- which was that he could be a forceful advocate for their conservative cause -- he 's left a complaint about Romney and attack him . But as a Gingrich adviser put it to me , what Gingrich needs to do is remind people by why they want to vote for Newt Gingrich not why Romney is bad and that message does n't look like it 's getting through . @!DUBOIS: So for Gingrich , going forward , the establishment is against him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't got the organization . He has to be worried tonight , do n't you think ? @!DICKERSON: They are worried . Those establishment attacks , the attacks from his peers , have hurt him , along with the barrage of negative ads . He 's trying it turn around the criticism saying he 's being attacked because he 's a challenge to the establishment , but that 's not working . Coming into the Florida , the Republican race was a contest of Gingrich 's momentum versus Romney 's superior money and organization . If Gingrich loses Florida and losses the momentum , we will lose his big advantage against the superior Romney machine . @!DUBOIS: OK , John Dickerson , thank you very much tonight . And later , what Florida small business leaders think of the Republican field . A fight over natural gas fracking in one small American town . And do n't call us and we wo n't call you . Have high-tech companies illegally agreed not to poach each other 's employees ? Those stories when the CBS EVENING NEWS continues . @!DUBOIS: They are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this week a federal judge ordered Google , Apple , and five other high-tech companies to court over accusations they violated antitrust laws by conspiring not to poach each other 's employees . Here 's Lee Cowan. @(BEGIN-VIDEOTAPE) @!LEE-COWAN-CBS-NEW: At issue is whether some of the titans of tech , including Apple and Google , conspired not to hire each other 's employees . A probe by the U.S. Justice Department revealed at least six companies kept " do not call " lists to avoid recruiting . The companies settled that antitrust complaints , but now the employees involve are seeking damages . Their lead attorney , Joe Severi , argues that the alleged conspiracy kept workers ' salaries artificially low by stifling competition . @!UNIDENTIFIED-MALE: They are definitely putting the interest of the company ahead of their employees , and that 's -- that 's fundamentally wrong . @!COWAN: According to just-released court filings , an e-mail leaked from Apple 's late CEO Steve Jobs , to Google Executive Eric Schmidt , about Google 's attempt to hire away an Apple engineer . Jobs write , " I would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Google 's response , the recruiter would be fired . " Please extend my apologies as appropriate to Steve Jobs " the Google e-mail read . @!UNIDENTIFIED-MALE: These were agreements that were hatched and implemented , spread and concealed at the highest levels of these companies . @!COWAN: Another document , he says , reveals that some executives felt uncomfortable with any arrangement . In an e-mail addressed to Steve Jobs from the then-CEO of Palm read , quote , " your proposal that we agree that neither couple will hire the other 's employees , regardless of the individual 's desires , is not only wrong . It 's likely illegal . " @(END-VIDEOTAPE) @!COWAN: All the companies insist that the case should be dismissed and argue any allegations of some grand conspiracy are implausible at best . But if the case does gain class action status , lawyers say damages would be in the hundreds of millions of dollars . Lee Cowan , CBS News , Los Angeles . @!DUBOIS: To Syria now , the Arab League today suspended its controversial monitoring mission in the country amid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an end to President Assad 's regime . At least 80 people have been killed in the past three days . Still ahead , a Pennsylvania town and its fracking fight for clean water . @!DUBOIS: President Obama this week pushed for expanding natural gas production as a way to fuel economic growth . Right now , the gas industry generates more than 600,000 jobs . That could grow to 870,000 by 2015 . Pennsylvania is already at the center of a natural gas boom , but as Tony Guida reports , the drilling in one town may be damaging the water . @(BEGIN-VIDEOTAPE) @!TONY-GUIDA-CBS-NE: In tiny Dimock , Pennsylvania , there is trouble just below the surface . Methane in some of the water wells , enough for ignition at the tap , made famous by a scene from the documentary " Gas Land . " Dimock , population 1,400 , has become ground zero in a national battle over hydraulic fracturing or fracking , a controversial technique for extracting natural gas . @!UNIDENTIFIED-MALE: I spent Christmas day looking for water . New Year 's Day looking for water . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and other residents of Dimock have live with contaminated wells for more than three years . In fact , tests analyze by the federal EPA found Sautner 's water contains toxic levels of arsenic , barium , manganese and glycol compounds known to be common in drilling fluids . The cause -- fracking by the Cabot Oil and Gas Company this according to John Hanger , former head of the State 's Department of Environmental Protection . @!UNIDENTIFIED-MALE: There are 18 water wells that have been impacted by poor gas drilling in Dimock. @!GUIDA: Fracking involves millions of gallons of sand , water , and potentially toxic chemicals blasted deep into the earth , shattering underground shale and freeing natural gas for collection . It 's at the surface where spills and blowouts cause chemically- infused water to seep into the water table . In 2008 , after testing the wells of concerned residents , Hanger 's agency wrote to Craig Sautner and other homeowners blaming the contaminated water on drilling activities conducted by Cabot Oil and Gas . @!UNIDENTIFIED-MALE: The water came out looking like coffee with milk in it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new wells and to deliver fresh water to affected residents . But now , three years later , Pennsylvania 's environmental agency has changed its mind . A new administration tells CBS News , " There is no evidence in Pennsylvania of fracking ever having contaminated drinking water . " And said Cabot no longer has to deliver water . @!UNIDENTIFIED-MALE: All of a sudden this year , they 're saying there 's nothing wrong with the water . How would he even know ? The guy has never been to Dimock nor does he ever plan on coming to Dimock. @!GUIDA: Enter the federal government . Eight days ago , the EPA made its first fresh water delivery to Dimock after its analysis raised flags . @!UNIDENTIFIED-MALE: Our ultimate goal is for everybody to have clean water . That 's all . @!GUIDA: Now , the EPA will do its own investigation of the water . Tony Guida , CBS News , New York . @(END-VIDEOTAPE) @!DUBOIS: The last American combat troops left Iraq in December .

Still ahead , Florida businessmen with different takes on the GOP candidates . That story is next . @!DUBOIS: Finally tonight , we return to the Republican primary in Florida where fully 98 percent of all businesses employ 100 or fewer people . Jacksonville is the biggest city in the conservative northern part of the state . A sampling of how local business owners there size up the Romney and Gingrich battle is tonight 's " Weekend Journal . " @(BEGIN-VIDEOTAPE) @!DUBOIS-@1voice-ove: The Jacksonville metro area is home to 1.4 million people , a busy port , and a growing high-tech sector . But the unemployment rate of 9.2 percent remains above the national average . @!UNIDENTIFIED-MALE: So this is a sheet press . @!DUBOIS: Twenty four of the newly unemployed worked for Jon Cummins until he shut down his printing company last month . The presses stand idle , for sale . @!UNIDENTIFIED-MALE: The overall business level has been down for a very long time and we did not know when it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @!DUBOIS: Cummins let the Romney campaign stage a rally here this week so he could meet the candidate . @!UNIDENTIFIED-MALE: I 'm definitely hoping that the economy turns around , whoever is in the White House . @!DUBOIS: The visit turned comments from undecided to Romney supporter . @!UNIDENTIFIED-MALE: He talked about a free market economy and ending government regulations that are crippling business and small business and it 's nutty how many new rules there are now . @!DUBOIS: Shawn Lednick also wants less regulation and lower taxes . Thirty people work for him , manufacturing medical devices and repairing industrial parts . Lednick considers Romney 's business experience too corporate . He 's backing Newt Gingrich. @!UNIDENTIFIED-MALE: I feel he 's the most qualified . He has some -- a lot of experience with speaker of the House . He presided over surplus . He presided over a budget that was actually balanced , things we are n't doing at the present time and I think he knows how to get back to that point . @!DUBOIS: Paul Nowaskey fixes motorcycles and sells them on consignment . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's debate in Jacksonville . @!GINGRICH: He 's not aware of the investments being made in his name . @!ROMNEY: I ca n't . It 's a blind trust . @!UNIDENTIFIED-MALE: I 'm sick and tired of the arguing between Romney and Gingrich . For me , I just do n't like the constant bringing up the baggage on both of them . You know , they 've got to cut that stuff out . @!DUBOIS: He 's backing Rick Santorum. @!UNIDENTIFIED-MALE: I do n't look at it as throwing away my vote . I look at it that I 'm backing the person they think would make an excellent president . @!DUBOIS: Ron Paul had been first choice for real estate financier Tarek Bateh , who helps developers acquire properties like this Hampton Inn , but now he 's voting for Romney to stop Gingrich. @!UNIDENTIFIED-MALE: I see him as very unstable , very much a hot head , can fly off the handle and rush to rash decisions . Further , I do n't see any track record of his in the business world . At least they would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lobbyist is not something I would be proud of . @(END-VIDEOTAPE) @!DUBOIS: Both Ron Paul and Rick Santorum have effectively conceded Florida and did not campaign in the state today .

But first , over to Lonnie for our final check of the weather . Lonnie . @!LONNIE-QUINN: All right . John and Nancy , good morning to you . And good morning everybody . Here are my weather headlines . There will be light snow for the Ohio Valley . Not a whole lot , one to two inches maybe , it 's going to feel like spring in the Mid-Atlantic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into -- in Montana because the winds are whipping in Missoula . Butte , Great Falls , some wind gusts for you , up to seventy-five miles per hour . That 's a hurricane-force-wind gust right there . Now with all that wind , use it for a National Kazoo Day . John , I told you , this is true . National Kazoo Day is today . Now , speaking of the date , January 28th , 2012 , just want to say a little hello to today 's zip Dade City . And that 's a city whose zip code matches the date . So January 28 , 2012 . Blue Mountain Lake , New York , zip code one-two-eight-one-two , January 28 , 2012 , hello to you with a partly sunny sky , temps in the forties . That 's a quick look at the national picture . Here 's a closer look at the weather for your weekend . @(LOCAL-WEATHER-BREA @!LONNIE-QUINN: All right . Guys , time for my Shout Out . We are shouting out this morning to Los Angeles . A little town called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thousands will line the streets to celebrate the lunar New Year . So in addition to floats and marching bands , there are going to be lots of firecrackers and I 'm guessing lots of dragons , too . We want to thank everybody for watching CBS THIS MORNING : SATURDAY on CBS2 . And now here 's John and Nancy with our Morning Coffee . @!JOHN-MILLER: Eighteen years ago , John F. Kennedy Junior hired an executive assistant named RoseMarie Terenzio . She quickly became his publicist and one of his closest confidantes right up until his death in 1999. @!NANCY-CORDES: Now she 's telling their story in a new book , Fairytale Interrupted , a memoir of life , love and loss . And RoseMarie Terenzio is with us this morning . Good morning , thanks for being with us. @!ROSEMARIE-TERENZIO: Hi , thanks for having me. @!NANCY-CORDES: So what motivated you to write about your relationship after all this time ? @!ROSEMARIE-TERENZIO: Well , I think a few things . One was that I would tell stories about how I 'm -- how did you -- the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had worked for him was , how did you get that job ? And when I told the story , they would -- such a great story , that such a great story . So there was that . And then I was interviewed in 19 -- 2009 about John 's charity . It was the twenty-year anniversary of his charity , and people started asking me again about what was it like to work there , what was George like . You know , where are you from ? How did you meet him ? You know , and so people started approaching me again about a book . And I felt like enough time had passed that I could write my Fairytale Interrupted and not -- not theirs . @!JOHN-MILLER: And -- and if this is a fairytale interrupted , I think the fairytale is Cinderella . @!ROSEMARIE-TERENZIO: Yeah , sort of . @!JOHN-MILLER: I mean , it 's -- it 's largely the story of a girl from the Bronx -- @!ROSEMARIE-TERENZIO: Yeah . @!JOHN-MILLER: -- who finds herself , from a blue-collar family -- @!ROSEMARIE-TERENZIO: Mm-Hm. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most glamorous figure , arguably . @!ROSEMARIE-TERENZIO: Yes . Yes . And it -- well , it takes you through sort of a bit of my childhood , and then the -- and then the job , and then obviously what happens and what -- what I do after . How do you come back from that ? How do you -- who do you work for after JFK Junior ? That there -- there are n't many people in the world that are as famous as he was . @!NANCY-CORDES: So tell us how did come to work for him and how your relationship sort of evolved to the point where he was really taking you into his inner circle and his wife . @!ROSEMARIE-TERENZIO: Yeah . @!NANCY-CORDES @(overlapping) : @(INDISTINCT) do , too . @!ROSEMARIE-TERENZIO: They -- they took me under their wing . And they were very good to me . I started -- I was working at a small boutique PR firm here in New York . My boss was Michael Berman . And John started coming into the office . And we could n't kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know , kind of tight-lipped about it . So one morning I came in on a Monday morning , and my office , which I loved , which was big and great and had a window , my office was being packed up . And it was him . And I said , excuse me , what are you doing ? And why you are touching my stuff ? And he looked at me like flabbergasted . And he was like , oh , hi . And then -- @!NANCY-CORDES: And his magazine was moving into your space . @!ROSEMARIE-TERENZIO: Yeah . And I did n't know that at the time . And I turned to look and I look -- I 'm looking at this box on the ground and there is my Howard Stern headshot ripped when he took it off my billboard . He ripped it . @!NANCY-CORDES @(overlapping) : And you knew who he was . You knew his whole background . @!ROSEMARIE-TERENZIO: Yeah . But I -- I grew up in a Republican family . And he was n't a political -- he was a political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But he was n't really in my orbit . So , you know , I was more like the girl , you know , in my twenties , I was -- I wanted the rock and roll guy . @!JOHN-MILLER: But what was -- what was the thing about your relationship with him , your professional relationship which he seemed to appreciate the idea that you had very little hesitation . In fact , the leaning to give him -- that 's not a TV word , Goth. @!ROSEMARIE-TERENZIO: Yeah . I mean I -- I -- I told it like it was . I -- I -- I always did . And I always -- and I do now . So I think he loved that because I did n't have the same idea of his fame that other people had . He was just there . @!NANCY-CORDES: Mm-Hm. @!ROSEMARIE-TERENZIO: And I -- I saw no reason not to tell him exactly how I felt . @!NANCY-CORDES: And you actually saw their marriage up close . And I think that the impression that people had was that they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this tension . But you did n't really see it that way . @!ROSEMARIE-TERENZIO: No . I mean they were just like every other couple , ups and downs . Cl -- but theirs is played out in public . I mean , if my pa -- if you saw my parents , some of my parent 's fights , they were worse than theirs . @!NANCY-CORDES: Right . @!JOHN-MILLER: Where would -- where would he be now , eighteen years later ? Would he be President Kennedy ? Would he be Senator Kennedy ? Would he be running George ? @!ROSEMARIE-TERENZIO: You know , I could -- I could never predict . I know that he talked about it . And it was something that , you know , he thought about . But he would never move to the next thing until George was a success . @!NANCY-CORDES: You think you 'd still be working with him today ? @!ROSEMARIE-TERENZIO: Oh , I hope so . I hope so . @!NANCY-CORDES: Yeah . Well , Rosemarie Terenzio , thank you so much for joining us -- @!ROSEMARIE-TERENZIO: Thank you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We really appreciate it .

You 're watching CBS THIS MORNING : SATURDAY . @(ANNOUNCEMENTS) @!JOHN-MILLER: We have quite a catch on The Dish this morning . And Chef Kerry Heffernan reeled it in . He 's known for his outstanding American fare at South Gate here in New York . @!NANCY-CORDES: He 's also an avid saltwater fly fisherman and he 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole black sea bass stuffed with crab . Good morning . @!KERRY-HEFFERNAN-@1: Good morning . @!NANCY-CORDES: That 's a lot of goodness . @!JOHN-MILLER: Yum . @!KERRY-HEFFERNAN: Thank you . @!NANCY-CORDES: Why is this your ultimate dish ? @!KERRY-HEFFERNAN: Well , it 's just -- to have a whole roast fish that you can stuff with crab meat , slice it , have no bones whatsoever , it 's -- it 's a little bit of work but it 's a great celebration , something very , very special . @!NANCY-CORDES: Is this something that people could ever make at home ? @!KERRY-HEFFERNAN: Sure . @!NANCY-CORDES: You know , people are afraid of whole fish . @!KERRY-HEFFERNAN: Yeah . It 's a little challenging . Quick hint -- you might want to do is make sure it 's at room temperature before you roast it . @!NANCY-CORDES: Uh-Huh . @!KERRY-HEFFERNAN: And the other thing is let it rest . You know , pull it out a little before you think it 's going to be done , let it rest about ten minutes . It 's really going to cook through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It smells incredible too , and it tastes great . Tell us about these side dishes . @!KERRY-HEFFERNAN: So we have mustard greens with shallots. @!NANCY-CORDES: Mm-Hm. @!KERRY-HEFFERNAN: We have a grated of rutabaga. @!NANCY-CORDES: Rutabaga. @!KERRY-HEFFERNAN: We have a clam chowder and a maple flan . And all this stuff is from the East End of Long Island . It 's all in season right now . Believe it or not . @!JOHN-MILLER: And you have a -- a near personal relationship with everything on this table . I mean , except -- except the fish . I mean , you -- you -- @!KERRY-HEFFERNAN: Yeah , I like to have a personal relationship @(INDISTINCT) @!JOHN-MILLER: You did n't meet him in life . But every -- everything else here you kind of dug up literally , right ? @!KERRY-HEFFERNAN: That 's right . The clams I harvested outside our -- our home in Sag Harbor . The oysters , we actually grow under our dock as part of the spat program to help -- @!NANCY-CORDES: You 're kidding . @!KERRY-HEFFERNAN: -- repopulate oysters . And , you know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great thing . @!NANCY-CORDES: You grow your own oysters ? @!KERRY-HEFFERNAN: Yeah . @!NANCY-CORDES: And then you just go under the dock and -- @!KERRY-HEFFERNAN: Pull them up . @!NANCY-CORDES: Pull them up . @!KERRY-HEFFERNAN: And whenever you want , there 's a -- there 's a dozen for you . @!NANCY-CORDES: And what are we drinking ? @!KERRY-HEFFERNAN: We have some great East End of Long Island wines . This is a Borghese Chardonnay on the North Fork . Very elegant . Also sustainable . Also a great , great winery on the East End . @!NANCY-CORDES: Mm-Hm. @!JOHN-MILLER: Okay . So when you -- when you think of -- of other chefs , you know , I read Bourdain 's book . There is always some magic moment where like the food bug bit them . How did you -- how did you become a great chef ? What was the moment ? @!KERRY-HEFFERNAN: Well , there were several moments . I kind of got a job at this place in -- where I grew up in Connecticut called Old McDonald 's Farm . And it 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Is it really Old McDonald Farms ? @!KERRY-HEFFERNAN: That 's right . @!JOHN-MILLER: Are there an Old McDonald ? @!KERRY-HEFFERNAN: Amusement park . There was animal but there was this great , great restaurant . We used to grind a chuck of beef every day for hamburgers . @!NANCY-CORDES: Mm-Hm. @!KERRY-HEFFERNAN: We had whole roast , you know , turkeys and pork loins and all this great stuff . And it was just then I did n't realize at the time this was sort of , you know , seeding . I was very lucky . My parents were very into food . @!NANCY-CORDES: Mm-Hm. @!KERRY-HEFFERNAN: Growing up on the coast , I had these great influences . @!JOHN-MILLER: But so -- so you 're from Pennsylvania . You grow up in Connecticut . But then you 're off to France and you 're exploring these tastes and living out of a tent . You 're kind of like a crazy renaissance man when you 're not digging up clams under the dock . @!KERRY-HEFFERNAN: Yeah . Those were the days . It was amazing . I was able to tour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the south , work in a bakery , you know , live in a tent , wake up on the beach . It was n't bad . @!NANCY-CORDES: Okay . So I skipped ahead to dessert . This is crazy . What is this ? It 's amazing . @!KERRY-HEFFERNAN: It 's as simple as a maple flan . You know , at South Gate , we do a lot of savory custards . But this is obviously a sweet one . It 's so easy to cook , very friendly , lots of flavors you can put into flan . @!NANCY-CORDES: And what is the white stuff on top ? Is that cream ? @!KERRY-HEFFERNAN: That 's a little bit of cream fresh . @!JOHN-MILLER: Creme fraiche . Yeah . @!NANCY-CORDES: Oh . @!KERRY-HEFFERNAN: So it 's a little bit -- @!NANCY-CORDES: So -- @!KERRY-HEFFERNAN: -- of a slightly dairy sour to -- @!NANCY-CORDES: -- so good . @!KERRY-HEFFERNAN: -- sort of break that up . @!NANCY-CORDES: So we always ask our chefs if you could share your perfect meal with someone who would it be ? @!JOHN-MILLER: I mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your second choice . @!KERRY-HEFFERNAN: Great , great , great company excluded . It would certainly be my family . My parents were both great cooks and inspirations . My wife and my sons help me go out and -- and dig the clams and tend to the oysters . So sharing it with them would -- would really be the ultimate moment . @!NANCY-CORDES: Yeah . @!JOHN-MILLER: All right . So we have a tradition here which is to sign the dish to The Dish . @!KERRY-HEFFERNAN: Okay . Here we go . @!NANCY-CORDES: Bold . Nice signature . @!JOHN-MILLER: Great . Great . Thank you very much . @!KERRY-HEFFERNAN: You can read the initials , at the very least . @!NANCY-CORDES: Yeah . Tell us a little bit about the restaurant where you are now , South Gate . @!KERRY-HEFFERNAN: It 's in the Essex House . @!NANCY-CORDES: Yep . @!KERRY-HEFFERNAN: And we 've been open for four years . @!NANCY-CORDES: Mm-Hm. @!KERRY-HEFFERNAN: It 's a lovely view of Central Park . And a lot of what we serve is -- is obviously highly seasonal . @!NANCY-CORDES: Mm-Hm. @!KERRY-HEFFERNAN: @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the local farmer 's market . Even this time of year , like I said , we can dig the clams . We have the rutabaga , the mustard greens all in season right now . @!NANCY-CORDES: Rutabaga is in season now ? And can you cook that just the same way you would cook potatoes ? @!KERRY-HEFFERNAN: Rutabaga is surprisingly friendly . You would make it like a puree just like mashed potatoes . @!NANCY-CORDES: Mm-Hm. @!KERRY-HEFFERNAN: People will love it . @!NANCY-CORDES: Oh , we do . Wow . Thank you , Kerry Heffernan from South Gate . @!KERRY-HEFFERNAN: Thank you . @!KERRY-HEFFERNAN: We really appreciate it . @!JOHN-MILLER: And -- and this was great .

We 'll talk with Bob Schieffer in Florida ahead of the presidential primary there . And actor and filmmaker Ed Burns will be here with us in Studio 57. @!NANCY-CORDES: Thanks , Erica . And next week on CBS THIS MORNING : SATURDAY , some people may be talking about a heated rivalry when the Giants take on the Patriots -- @!BETTY-NGUYEN: Oh , yeah . @!NANCY-CORDES: -- in Super Bowl XLVI . But right here , we have the cutest rivalry when we bring you the puppy bowl . Oh , that is cute . @!BETTY-NGUYEN: It 's going to be -- I ca n't wait . @!NANCY-CORDES: That 's so cute . And I can not get over this flan . @!BETTY-NGUYEN: It is amazing . @!NANCY-CORDES: It 's so good . @!JOHN-MILLER: Yes . @!NANCY-CORDES: I do n't know if I like this better than clam chowder. @!JOHN-MILLER: Ca n't believe . @!LONNIE-QUINN: Nancy , did you guys bring over stuff for Betty ? @!NANCY-CORDES: We 've got more . @!BETTY-NGUYEN: I almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would cover the table .

##4103547 @!NANCY-CORDES: And welcome to CBS THIS MORNING : SATURDAY . I 'm Nancy Cordes. @!JOHN-MILLER: And I 'm John Miller . Look out Slash and Eddie Van Halen , a new guitar hero is on the rise and she 's only eight years old . Coming up , you 'll meet Zoe Thompson who 's become an internet sensation shredding the frets on classics like " Sweet Child of Mine " and Metallica 's " Sandman. " @!NANCY-CORDES: Shredding the frets . I like that . And he had a fairytale life . But what was John F. Kennedy Junior really like ? We 'll talk to one of the people who knew the so-called Prince of Camelot best . But first to Campaign 2012 ; Mitt Romney and Newt Gingrich will be looking for votes in Florida today , hoping to reel in undecided Republicans ahead of Tuesday 's key primary . Gingrich appeared to have the edge after his victory in South Carolina . But the polls now show Romney pulling ahead . Let 's get the latest on the hard-fought campaign from Jan Crawford who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to you . And Newt Gingrich has come from behind a few times before . Can he do it again now ? @!JAN-CRAWFORD: Well , Nancy , I -- as you know , if we look back to even at the end of the summer , how many people were saying Newt Gingrich 's campaign was dead ? I mean , that 's what all the experts were saying . And then , of course , New Hampshire and then Iowa , he finished at or near the bottom . So who would have thought he would have had that dominant win in South Carolina ? And even though the polls do show Romney pulling out a little bit ahead , those polls can change and they were sure wrong in South Carolina . So it would be a huge mistake to say that , you know , Romney 's got this race in the bag , although , we have seen Romney sounding more confident , more aggressive , more forceful this week as he 's been taking on Newt Gingrich , particularly in those two debates . And I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear in Pensacola at the Fish House , that 's a legendary restaurant . If you 're a politician , you have to stop here . This is very conservative country . You would think Romney may not think this is fertile ground for him . This maybe Newt Gingrich 's country , but he 's really taking it to Gingrich , and he is bringing out the big guns . He 's got actor Jon Voight , Senator John McCain is here , the Virginia governor is here . So he 's really going to make an all-out push for every vote he can get . @!NANCY-CORDES: All right . Such an important primary , now just three days away . Jan Crawford , we know you 'll be on it . Thank you so much . And now , for more of the morning 's headlines , let 's head over to the CBS News correspondent and MORNING NEWS anchor Betty Nguyen . Good morning . @!BETTY-NGUYEN: Good morning to you both . And good morning to you at home . Defense Secretary Leon Panetta says he believes Pakistani @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country for years before he was killed in the raid by U.S. Navy SEALs . In an interview for 60 MINUTES , Panetta also criticized Pakistan for arresting a doctor who helped the U.S. locate bin Laden and charging him with treason . @!LEON-PANETTA: Pakistan and the United States have a common cause here against terrorism , have a common cause against al Qaeda , have a common cause against those who would attack not only our country but their country . And for them to take this kind of action against somebody who was helping to go after terrorism , I just think is a real mistake on their part . @!BETTY-NGUYEN: And you can see Scott Pelley 's entire interview with Secretary Panetta , Sunday evening right here on 60 MINUTES . Well , a seventeenth body has been recovered this morning from that capsized cruise ship off Italy . Fifteen people are still missing . Meanwhile , rough seas has suspended plans to pump fuel off the ship in Italy to day . There is more than two tons of diesel on the Costa Concordia that is enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Democrats and Republicans remain fiercely divided in Washington , but there is a friendly bipartisan meeting yesterday at the White House . President Obama welcomed a former President George H.W. Bush and his son , former Florida governor Jeb Bush , for a personal visit . The Bushes are in Washington to attend a dinner where Mister Obama will be speaking . Arizona 's governor has scheduled a special election this spring to replace Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords . Giffords resigned this week to focus on her recovery . She was shot in the head last year in an attempted assassination . Six people were killed in that attack . A primary election to replace Giffords will be held in April . A general election is scheduled for June . Former Penn State Coach Jerry Sandusky is seeking permission to visit with his grandchildren . The former assistant football coach at Penn State is accused of sexually molesting ten boys and is under house arrest . Sandusky 's bail arrangement bars him from having contact with anyone under the age of eighteen . He is asking a judge to allow his grandkids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it 's about five minutes past the hour , time now for another check of the weather . And for that , who do we go to ? @!LONNIE-QUINN: Me. @!BETTY-NGUYEN: But , of course , Lonnie Quinn . @!LONNIE-QUINN: All right . @!BETTY-NGUYEN: Man of the hour . @!LONNIE-QUINN: Hey , good morning to you , Betty . @!BETTY-NGUYEN: Good morning . @!LONNIE-QUINN: Good morning , everybody . Here are my weather headlines for you . It is mild today in the Mid-Atlantic . A little snow falls in the Ohio Valley ; a little snow , maybe one to two inches . I 'll tell you , east of the Mississippi , it feels like a snow drought out there for some . Now I want to talk specifically about New York City . This is just one example , okay ? So far , all right , this season New York City has picked up 7.2 inches . Now I say how it feels like a snow drought . When you compare it to last year , last year at this point in time , New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's -- with that much more snow last year than we have this year , but is it a snow drought ? We 'll look what the average is . The average for this time of the year would be eleven inches . So we 're actually about four inches behind schedule . In terms of the big picture , the satellite and radar picture , specifically radar showing that little bit of snow pushing through the Ohio Valley not going to be a big storm . I 've got a little system pushing onshore around the Pacific Northwest . Otherwise , I just call it clean and green . That 's a quick look at the national picture . Here 's a close look at the weather for your weekend . @(LOCAL-WEATHER-BREA @!LONNIE-QUINN: I 'll tell you what wherever you 're today you make it a great day . And Nancy , over to you . @!NANCY-CORDES: Thanks , Lonnie . We 'll grab the Whack-a-Mole . Next Sunday is the Super Bowl . And not only is it the biggest football game of the season , it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paying an average of three and a half million dollars for a thirty-second ad . In 1967 , for the first Super Bowl , it cost only forty-two thousand dollars . Here 's a look at some of the most popular Super Bowl commercials over the last forty years . @(Excerpt-from-Noxze @(Excerpt-from-Xerox @(Excerpt-from-Coca- @(Excerpt-from-The-B @(Excerpt-from-Pepsi @(Excerpt-from-Snick @(Excerpt-from-Volks @!NANCY-CORDES: Here now with a sneak peak at some of next week 's big Super Bowl ads is Barbara Lippert , an advertising expert and historian for Goodby , Silverstein &amp; Partners in San Francisco . Good morning , Barbara . And -- @!BARBARA-LIPPERT-@1: Good morning , hi . @!NANCY-CORDES: 3.5 million dollars for thirty seconds ? @!BARBARA-LIPPERT: And up to four million , maybe . But -- @!NANCY-CORDES: Is that a record ? @!BARBARA-LIPPERT: It is a record . Every year it goes up exponentially . But people are getting so much more exposure now because it 's all over the internet early . @!NANCY-CORDES: Right . @!BARBARA-LIPPERT: They 're teasing it early . There is so much social media and talk about it that there are bigger audiences than ever for it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but these live marquee events have more people watching than ever . And it 's the only place you can get half of America to watch your commercial and they 're watching for the ads. @!NANCY-CORDES: And it 's a really interesting strategy that these ad companies are now leaking the ads on the web ahead of time or sometimes ads for the ads like a trailer . Take a look at one that 's sweeping the internet right now . @(Excerpt-from-Ferri @!BARBARA-LIPPERT: Totally brilliant . People love it . On the day of the Super Bowl , everyone feels like you 're in high school and you want to play hooky . And everyone wants to see what Matthew Broderick is doing twenty-five years later . There is talk it is for Honda . So that would make sense , too , to go from a Majorette to Honda these days . @!NANCY-CORDES: I 'm -- I must be the target audience for that because I love it although I do n't know if anybody under thirty will get it . @!BARBARA-LIPPERT: Oh , no . They -- they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We 're into ' 80s nostalgia now . @!NANCY-CORDES: Right . @!BARBARA-LIPPERT: So I think people under thirty know it . @!NANCY-CORDES: Obviously , it is a reference to Feller -- Ferris Bueller 's Day Off with matt -- which Matthew Broderick was in , in the ' 80s . Talk about this year 's ads . I mean , every year , of course , we 've got a lot of sex , a lot of women practically naked and a lot of monkeys . Is that what we 're going to see again this year ? @!BARBARA-LIPPERT: Right , right . Well , yeah . People have learned to watch for funny animals , you know . @!NANCY-CORDES: Right . @!BARBARA-LIPPERT: So we 're going to get our , you know , the sex , the chimps . Every year , more men take more shots to the groin than you can believe , you know , for the job . @!NANCY-CORDES: Yes , yeah . @!BARBARA-LIPPERT: This is Go Daddy . And they 've made , you know , a genius business out of , like , cheesy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @!BARBARA-LIPPERT: I never like it . But they 're back every year . Danica is great . She 's made a career -- the -- this is Career Builders and the chimps. @!NANCY-CORDES: Right . Oh , yes . @!BARBARA-LIPPERT: And they -- they claim that they wanted to do something else but they had to bring them back because they 're so popular . People are really disappointed if they do n't get to see the chimps. @!NANCY-CORDES: Right . Let 's take a look at another ad because every year , Chevrolet has a contest . A lot of companies do this , now where they run a contest to -- for who comes up with the best ads . So let 's take a look at Chevrolet 's entry this time around . @(Excerpt-from-Chevr @!NANCY-CORDES: That 's good . @!BARBARA-LIPPERT: Right -- right . A twenty-six-year-old kid from Long Island did it . His name is Zach Borst who won twenty five thousand dollars . And it 's nice because it shows a kid who would really appreciate a Camaro for graduation gift -- @!NANCY-CORDES: Right . @!BARBARA-LIPPERT: @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mm-Hm. @!BARBARA-LIPPERT: And then there is something really funny about a mini- fridge . @!NANCY-CORDES: Right . @!BARBARA-LIPPERT: Let 's face it . @!NANCY-CORDES: Okay . Let 's take a look at one more ad because I love this one , as a Twilight fan , this is a great ad . Take a look . @!BARBARA-LIPPERT: Vampires ca n't get enough . @(Excerpt-from-Audi- @!NANCY-CORDES: Pretty smart to play off -- @!BARBARA-LIPPERT: Headlights . @!NANCY-CORDES: -- the popularity of vampires right now . @!BARBARA-LIPPERT: Headlights like daylights , yeah . @!NANCY-CORDES: Yeah . @!BARBARA-LIPPERT: That -- that will really get the kids . And the thing is in the old days people would say you really need the element of surprise . You ca n't release it early . Now , you know , last year the Force was released early and it got forty-nine million hits on YouTube . And people now know to watch for the commercials they want to see because otherwise , they 're drunk on Whack-a-Mole and they ca n't really get it -- @!NANCY-CORDES: Yeah . @!BARBARA-LIPPERT: -- during the game itself . @!NANCY-CORDES: Exactly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ VW does this year . Barbara Lippert , ad expert , thank you so much for joining us this morning . @!BARBARA-LIPPERT: Thank you . @!NANCY-CORDES: Appreciate it . And up next , the real Al Capone ; his grandniece talks about what it was like growing up with the man once known as public enemy number one . You 're watching CBS THIS MORNING : SATURDAY . @(ANNOUNCEMENTS) @(Excerpt-from-The-U @!JOHN-MILLER: That was incredible . Robert De Niro playing Al Capone in the movie , Untouchables . Now during the Prohibition in the 1920s , Capone quickly became Chicago 's biggest crime boss and public enemy number one . Now sixty-five years after his death , his grandniece Deirdre Marie has written a book titled , Uncle Al Capone. @!DEIRDRE-MARIE-@1Au: Correct . @!JOHN-MILLER: Now , that 's not something everyone can say , actually , you 're the only one . @!DEIRDRE-MARIE: Correct . I 'm the last person that was born with the name Capone that was part of the Al Capone family . @!JOHN-MILLER: Okay , so we think of Al Capone as public enemy number one . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as public enemy number three . @!DEIRDRE-MARIE CAPONE : Yep . @!JOHN-MILLER: But you 're a seven-year-old girl -- @!DEIRDRE-MARIE CAPONE : Correct . @!JOHN-MILLER: -- growing up in this world . Men with guns , you know , show up at the house . @!DEIRDRE-MARIE CAPONE : Correct . @!JOHN-MILLER: And -- and post the front and the back when Uncle Al comes to visit . @!DEIRDRE-MARIE CAPONE : Correct . @!JOHN-MILLER: What was that like as a kid ? @!DEIRDRE-MARIE CAPONE : It was normal for me . I -- you know , I kind of knew that something was a little different than the children that I went to school with . But it was normal . There was never a moment that I was ever afraid , you know , feared for anything . It was after I left the Capone house that I became fearful and afraid of who I was , because there were a lot of people out there that would love to kill the last Capone. @!JOHN-MILLER: All right . Now the image you paint of Al Capone , great book , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The image you paint of Al Capone in the book is -- is really a- - a stretch for me . He 's playing on the floor with you -- with your toys . He teaches you to play cards , how to play the mandolin . He 's laughing raucously while making spaghetti sauce . He seems like a great family guy . And not that family , I mean , regular family . @!DEIRDRE-MARIE CAPONE : And he was . But one day he was , you know , out in the kitchen singing , making spaghetti sauce and his sister , my aunt Mafi @(ph) , came to him and said that there were some people at the front door that wanted to see him . And so he looked and he went , got a cigar and his suit coat . I followed him into the parlor . These two men came in and I saw my uncle change expressions . And he sat there and he got this glare in his face and he got stiff and rigid and started grunting . And I thought , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw before . @!JOHN-MILLER: Now there 's a quote in the beginning of the book saying , you know , I had to do some things I did n't want to do . @!DEIRDRE-MARIE CAPONE : Correct . @!JOHN-MILLER: You know , you think of imagery that time , like , the Saint Valentine 's Day Massacre and brutality . @!DEIRDRE-MARIE CAPONE : Correct . @!JOHN-MILLER: But he said I 'm not as black as they paint me to be . Did history get him wrong ? He was a gangster and a killer -- @!DEIRDRE-MARIE CAPONE : He was . @!JOHN-MILLER: -- and a violent man . @!DEIRDRE-MARIE CAPONE : I equate that part of American history to the Wild West . In the Wild West , if you wrestled somebody 's cattle or stole someone 's woman , you know , there was retribution to be paid . You know , the cowboys with line up on either end of the street , walk toward each other , and whoever fired first fell to the ground . And that 's the way it was . My grandfather swore to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person was ever hurt . No woman was ever made to do anything she did not choose to do . And no child 's life was ever in danger . And I believe that . But , yes , they went into the business knowing full well that they needed to -- to do their job . @!JOHN-MILLER: So just briefly , this cost you . You did n't get invited to birthday parties at school . @!DEIRDRE-MARIE CAPONE : Correct . @!JOHN-MILLER: You lost a job . Do you regret being a -- @!DEIRDRE-MARIE CAPONE : And I lost a father , too . @!JOHN-MILLER: -- who committed suicide . @!DEIRDRE-MARIE CAPONE : Yeah . @!JOHN-MILLER: Do you regret being a Capone ? @!DEIRDRE-MARIE CAPONE : For a long time , yes , I did , John . @!JOHN-MILLER: All right . Well , interesting perspective on history . Great book . Deirdre Marie Capone , thanks . @!DEIRDRE-MARIE CAPONE : Thank you very much for having me here . @!JOHN-MILLER: Good to you have . Up next , a pint-sized guitar prodigy ; the little girl who can rock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : SATURDAY . @(ANNOUNCEMENTS) @!NANCY-CORDES: There 's a little girl in England whose gift on the guitar is causing quite a sensation . Eight-year-old Zoe Thompson became an internet sensation because she can really play . Correspondent Charlie D'Agata takes a look at the child prodigy who is rocking the house . @(Begin-VT) @!CHARLIE-D'AGATA: The internet is full of cute kids playing instruments . But none that rock out on the guitar quite like this . @(Excerpt-from-inter @!CHARLIE-D'AGATA: That 's eight-year-old Zoe Thomson wielding that axe for the band , Mini Band . Zoe 's ability to master notoriously difficult rifts , moving those little fingers up and down the fret with extraordinary speed has impressed music fans worldwide . She was first catapulted to fame with her take of Metallica 's " Enter the Sandman . " The band 's performance even got the attention of the heavy metal rockers themselves . @!LARS-ULRICH-@1inte: You guys rock . @!MAN: Yeah . @!LARS-ULRICH: You guys are very cool . Maybe one day we could work something out . We could come out and open up for y'all , y'all. @!CHARLIE-D'AGATA: So step @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Van Halen . There 's a new guitar slinger in town and her name is Zoe Thomson .

Or was this something that your parents introduced to you ? @!ZOE-THOMSON: I asked my mom to start to give me lessons . @!NANCY-CORDES: So how did the band get formed ? It 's called The Mini Band . I 'm pretty sure that you guys do n't all go to school together . Did you meet at a music camp ? @!ZOE-THOMSON: We meet -- we met rock school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a band . @!NANCY-CORDES: And you guys love Metallica . And they love you back , obviously . What do you really like about their music ? @!ZOE-THOMSON: It 's just my favorite . It 's just really great . @!NANCY-CORDES: Collette , when did you first realize that you had a prodigy on your hands here ? @!COLLETTE-THOMSON ( Zoe 's Mother ) : Well , when she started lessons , she just picked things up really quickly . And she just enjoys playing rock music so much that she progressed very , very fast . And I think over the last year , you know , she 's -- she 's played some really quite difficult pieces of music . @!NANCY-CORDES: Mm-Hm. @!COLLETTE-THOMSON: And obviously recently it 's -- it 's been recognized by -- by famous people . But , you know , it 's unusual for someone of her age to -- to play at the standard she is. @!NANCY-CORDES: Yep . And it 's also unusual for a girl , I think . A lot of people are used to watching men sort of rule @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do next ? Do you really love the electric guitar ? Do you want to play in a band ? Do you want to make this your career ? @!ZOE-THOMSON: Yeah , I really want to be a rock star and play like really big stadiums. @!NANCY-CORDES: Well , you 've got a lot of fans already . You 've gotten how many millions of hits on YouTube so far ? And this was just a video that somebody made at one of your performances , right ? That 's what got it all started ? @!ZOE-THOMSON: Yeah . @!COLLETTE-THOMSON: Yeah . @!NANCY-CORDES: Well , we -- we 're going to ask you guys , if you do n't mind Zoe , we 're going to go to a break . So if you would n't mind playing us off the air , we would really appreciate it . And congratulations again , you 're really a phenom. @(Zoe-Thomson-playin @(ANNOUNCEMENTS)
